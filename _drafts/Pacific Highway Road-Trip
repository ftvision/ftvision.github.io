Pacific Highway Road-Trip

=First day=

Destination: 
	1. Malibu Beach (Quiet, rich area, cliff and lonely beach)
	2. Santa Barbara (nice place, didn't find a good place on campus, surfing is everywhere)
	3. Elephant seal Rockery (lovely place to see lazy, relaxing elephant seal)
	4. Piedras Blancas Light house ï¼ˆnow only by appointment, so didn't enter)

=Second day=

Destination:
	1. Hearst Castle (Great place, definitely need to go; where the beauty starts)
	2. Around Ragged Point (wind, long road in the mountain. Ocean on the left, mountain on the right)
	3. Big Sur (Pfeifer Beach is a good secret place, state park has been closed, didn't see the fall)
	4. Monterey / 17 miles (It's a beautiful place. 17-mile drive is a seashore fantasy as well as richmen place, but I personally like the ocean view ave. This lovely colorful little town deserves a stay)
	5. Half moon bay (sunset is good)
	6. San Francisco (just arrived)

=Third day=

Destination
	1. Facebook
	2. Twitter
	3. Google

=Fourth day=

Destination
	1. San Francisco (Lombard st. & Golden Gate, really hilly, Jones road goes up and down like a hill, and the road is really steep)
	2. Eureka: The road to Eureka is really, really winding. It took me long time to arrive at Eureka when it was 11:00 p.m at night. However, the road was scenic, and I saw Elk. I picked up a hitchhiker who is an anarchist. Interesting. 

=Fifth day=

Destination
	1. Redwood National Park (The big tree is really impressive. All the way along the redwood is magnificent; Drive through tree is also impressive, but to artificial.)
	2. Oregon Coast Highway: Not as close to the coast as CA Route 1. When the road is between the woods, it looks great; Missed Bandon Sunset because I was too early when I arrived Bandon; Near Coos bay, I saw lots of logging and lumber along the road in the ground, which was HUGE.   
	3. Florence (Coastal small Town; get FINED $160 because of overspeed)

=Sixth day=

Destination
	1. Sand Master Park
	2. Astoria
	3. Seattle

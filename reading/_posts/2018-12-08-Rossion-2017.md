In responding to Chang and Tsao (2017)'s cell paper on monkey face recognition, Rossion and Taubert argued that monkey studies does not really help us to learn more about human face recognition. This is a short and interesting piece of commentary to read because it asks people to think about pros and cons (validity and invalidity) of animal studies that claim to help understand human cognition.

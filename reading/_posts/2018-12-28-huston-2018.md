Huston talked about the reproducibility crisis in recent artificial intelligence research. Among recent papers, only 6% included code, 30% included test data, and 54% included pseudo-code. Readers can hardly find technique details such as hyperparameters and sometimes find it hard to reproduce the excellent performances reported in papers.

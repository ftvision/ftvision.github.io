Expanded from their commentary in 2017, Rossion and Taubert detailed why it does not really help us to learn from human individual face recognition from monkey experiments. This piece can inspire us to think what monkey experiments actually can help us to learn about human face perception. After all, human face perception is more than *individualization*.

Lisi and Cavanagh showed a striking peripheral perceptual illusion that a obliquely translating Gabor is perceived to go straight vertically. What's more interesting is that this perceptual illusion is dissociated from a saccadic landing position: if one saccades to the translating Gabor, her landing position is faithful to the Gabor's true, physical trajectory.

It turned out that this experiment is not easy to be cleanly replicated. One of my friend had tried to replicate it multiple times, but something is missing.

Sculley and his colleagues at Google AI talked about how recent empirical research in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, lacks of rigor criteria. They illustrated several cases studies that showed that "new developments" in the field actually may not beat the "old" baseline performances. Not being rigorous in research, as reasoned by the authors, not only failed to increase our **knowledge**, but also prevented rapid future developments.

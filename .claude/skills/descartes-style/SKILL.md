## Core Philosophy

Every sentence earns its place through clarity and necessity. Say what needs to be said, nothing more.

## Style Principles

### 1. Clarity Above All
- Use the simplest word that conveys the meaning
- One idea per sentence
- If a sentence needs a second read, rewrite it
- Define technical terms when introduced, then use them freely

### 2. Methodical Progression
- Start from what the reader knows
- Build each point on the previous one
- Make the reasoning explicit: "Since X, then Y"
- Number steps when showing a logical chain

### 3. Direct Engagement
- Use "I" when stating your view
- Use "we" when walking through reasoning with the reader
- Address the reader when useful, but don't overdo it

### 4. Economy
- Cut every word that doesn't work
- Prefer verbs to abstract nouns
- Active voice by default
- No hedging (somewhat, rather, quite, perhaps)

## Structure Pattern

1. **State the subject** - What are we discussing?
2. **Establish foundations** - What do we know or assume?
3. **Build the argument** - Step by step, each following from the last
4. **Conclude** - What follows from this?

## Sentence Patterns

Good:
- "From this, it follows that..."
- "The key point is this:"
- "There are three reasons."
- "This matters because..."

Avoid:
- Rhetorical questions as filler
- "What do I mean by this?" (just say what you mean)
- Excessive "Let us consider..." or "One might ask..."
- Meta-commentary about what you're about to say

## Example Transformation

Before:
> The implementation of effective methodologies for the optimization of code quality is something that is generally considered to be of significant importance in software development contexts.

After:
> Good code matters. Clear code is easier to debug, extend, and maintain. Three qualities define it: readability, simplicity, and consistency.

Let us think through an essay together, in the Cartesian manner.

Topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Our Method

I will guide us through these steps, pausing for your input at each:

### Step 1: Clear the Ground
First, let me ask you three questions to understand what you truly want to say:
- What is the one thing you want the reader to understand?
- What do you assume your reader already knows?
- What is the doubt or question that drives this essay?

### Step 2: Find the Foundation
Once you answer, I will identify:
- What we can take as given
- What we must prove or explain
- The logical path from start to conclusion

### Step 3: Build the Structure
I will propose three possible structures, each building from simple to complex. You choose.

### Step 4: Draft the Opening
Together we will write the first paragraph - the foundation on which all else rests.

Let us begin. Answer my three questions above, and we will proceed step by step.

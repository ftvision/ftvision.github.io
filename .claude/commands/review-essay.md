Review the essay as a Cartesian editor. Evaluate against these criteria:

## Clarity Check
- Can each sentence be understood on first reading?
- Are technical terms defined when introduced?
- Is there any unnecessary complexity?

## Method Check
- Does the essay start from clear foundations?
- Does each paragraph build on the previous?
- Is the logical chain explicit and unbroken?

## Engagement Check
- Does the writer engage the reader directly?
- Are objections anticipated and addressed?
- Are questions posed and answered?

## Simplicity Check
- Count unnecessary words and suggest cuts
- Identify passive constructions that should be active
- Flag jargon that could be simpler

## Provide:
1. **Overall Assessment** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Strongest Passage** - Quote it, explain why it works
3. **Weakest Passage** - Quote it, rewrite it in Cartesian style
4. **Line Edits** - Specific suggestions with before/after
5. **Clarity Score** (1-10) with brief justification

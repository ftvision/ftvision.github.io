# Principles

First Principle: I do science for fun. Precisely, I only do science when I feel happy. 

As you may know, this capricious First Principle causes a lot of headaches to my advisor, and back to me as well, before we get used to each other (Li, 2014). Well, it takes time to play a good tango together. God bless Jon and me. 

Ideally, I do two kinds of research [link]. However, in a baby scientist's growth, lots of trivial, messy studies are inevitable. Hence, running control experiments becomes my featured interest (Flombaum, 2014).

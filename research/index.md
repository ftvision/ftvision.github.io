<h1><a name="principle">Principles</a></h1>

**First Principle**: <span style="color:red">I do science for fun. Precisely, I do science only when I feel happy. </span>

As you may know, this whimsical First Principle causes a lot of headaches to my advisor, and back to me as well, before we get along with each other (Li, 2014). Well, it takes time to play a good tango together. God bless Jon and me. 

Ideally, I do [two kinds of research]({% post_url 2014-07-11-research-deserve-to-do %}). However, in a baby scientist\'s growth, lots of trivial, messy studies are inevitable. Hence, running control experiments becomes my featured interest (Flombaum, 2014).

<h1><a name="ancestry">Bloodline</a></h1>

Academic bloodline not only tells about where am I from, but also tells about my approaches to asking and answering questions. Years of training under specific advisors\' supervision shapes who I am and where I am. 

[Jonathan Flombaum](http://pbs.jhu.edu/research/flombaum/facultyinfo/) runs the [visual thinking lab](http://www.jhuvisualthinkinglab.com) in Johns Hopkins University where I started my apprenticeship from 2013. This supersmart New Yorker has his own pride and prejudice. He cares deeply about algorithms used by human mind. But it remains mysterious whether or not he gives a damn to how brain works to implement potential algorithms. We are developing our relationship.  

[Sheng Li](http://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/faculty.php?fid=39) runs the [Cognition and Cognition Lab](http://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/~lisheng/) in Peking University where I stayed from 2009 to 2013. He came from Computer Science background and started revealing human brain mechanism when he worked with Zoe Kourtzi. This Scorpian was my Academic and Life mentor during my stay in his lab. He indeed knew me inside out.

<h1><a name="topic">Topics</a></h1>
Before PhD-Tenured[^1], I will not specify my research interests. But these keywords may help: vision, unconciousness, debate, computation, brain.

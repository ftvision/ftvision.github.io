智能即是算法；智能算法；

作为一个计算功能主义者，在我看来，智能便是一套能够让主体灵活应对和适应环境中的变化，并作出恰当反应的算法过程。

1. 那么单细胞动物的应激反应算不算是智能呢？
2. 那么水绕开树木流走，从高处流入海洋，这算不算是智能呢？

> It's easy to know explicit hypotheses, but it's hard to notice implicit hypothesis. When people are debating each other, they seems to disagree on explicit hypothese, but they may actually disagree on implicit ones. 

If we make an assumption that we can get **all the data we need**, whether we can predict exactly what will happen?

- **explicit hypothesis**: we can get all the data we need
- **implicit hypothesis**: can we have theories that make sense of all these data? Are our theories determinsitic? Are our theories true, and are our theories THE theories? Are THE theories have randomness?

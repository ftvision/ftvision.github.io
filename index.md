## Hello World!

Welcome! This is my research / learning note website. 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate who studies human vision and cognition at Johns Hopkins University. 

You can visit my <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=94Xx9u0AAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> page to see my publication journey in Academia, and trace my academic ancestors along the <a href="http://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=65050" id="NT">NeuroTree</a>.

Sims set out to understand the underlying computational reason of the observed *universal law of generalization* in human perception. He applied an information-theory idea to perception data. It turns out that that information-theory idea can naturally lead the model to give rise to a exponential decay in perceptual generalization.

This week's code breaking focuses on understanding the codes that accompany the paper [Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/652), and the original code is hosted [here at Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/x5ckn/).

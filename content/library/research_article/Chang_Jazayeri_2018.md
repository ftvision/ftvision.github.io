title: Integration of speed and time for estimating time to contact
authors: [Chang, Jazayeri, ]
year: 2018
publication: PNAS
tags: [Psych, Motion]

outline: Chang and Jazayeri has included a new variable <strong>time</strong> into the model of motion perception. A Bayesian model that integrate <em>time</em> with <em>speed</em>, which, we all knew, is important for motion perception, can explain human perception better than models before.

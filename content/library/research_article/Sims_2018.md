title:  Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception
authors: [Sims, ]
year: 2018
publication: Science
tags: [Psych, Perception, Modeling]
citation: Sims, C. R. (2018). Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception. Science, 360(6389), 652-656.
outline: "Sims set out to understand the underlying computational reason of the observed <em>universal law of generalization</em> in human perception. He applied an information-theory idea to perception data. It turns out that that information-theory idea can naturally lead the model to give rise to a exponential decay in perceptual generalization."

This week's code breaking focuses on understanding the codes that accompany the paper [Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/652), and the original code is hosted [here at Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/x5ckn/).

My analysis and Python-transformation are [here at Github]()

## 总结

Bjarne Stroustrup talked about his thoughts and ideas of designing the C++ language -- what C++ is and what C++ is not. At least in his mind, C++ should be:
> C++ is ageneral-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that
> - is a better C
> - supports data abstraction
> - supports object-oriented programming
> - supports generic programming
Bjarne talked about several language myths in C++, argued against several of them and pointed out why those myths were wrong.

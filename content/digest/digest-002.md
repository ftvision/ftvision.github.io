Martin Kleppmann, the author of *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, explains reflects on his experiences of publishing the book.

  - Metrics: 100,000 copies sold.
  - Financial perspective: a good passive income since the book is very popular. The profit for each book is small, but the time and the number helps.
  - Beyond the royalities: 50 talks, blog posts, and other social media helps establish a significant public presence and reputation in this field.
    - this kind of reputation is helpful for getting consulting gigs.
  - That is further financial value that writing a book can bring: you become recognised as an expert and an authority in an area, and companies will pay good money to get advice from such experts.
  >  I also find it heartening that it is possible to make a decent living from technical writing. Not guaranteed, but possible, and that gives me hope.
  - A book is accessible education
    - A book is universally accessible: it is affordable to almost everyone, anywhere in the world.
    >Of course there are also plenty of free resources online: Wikipedia, blog posts, videos, Stack Overflow, API documentation, research papers, and so on. These are good as reference material for answering a concrete question that you have (such as “what are the parameters of the function foo?”), but they are piecemeal fragments that are difficult to assemble into a coherent education.
    - Compared to teaching people in person, a book is vastly more scalable.
  - Creating more value than you capture
    > Writing a book is an activity that creates more value than it captures. What I mean with this is that the benefits that readers get from it are greater than the price they paid for the book. To back this up, let’s try roughly estimating the value created by my book.
    > If I spend 2.5 years writing a book, and it saves other people 833 years of time in aggregate, that is over 300x leverage.

> How to be a 10x engineer: help ten other engineers be twice as good. Producing high-quality educational materials enables you to be a 300x engineer.

Writing a technical book is not easy, but it is:

- valuable (it helps people be better at their job),
- scalable (large numbers of people can benefit from it),
- accessible (it doesn’t discriminate who can benefit), and
- economically viable (it is possible to generate a reasonable level of income from it).

On the downside, writing a book is really hard, at least if you want to do it well. For me it was about the same level of difficulty as building and selling a startup (YMMV), that is to say, involving multiple existential crises. The writing process was not good for my mental health.

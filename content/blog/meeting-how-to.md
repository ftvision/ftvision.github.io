  > every meeting needs an official record(/log/minutes/whatever) documenting all noteworthy decisions (D), tasks (T, with deadline and responsible person), and information communicated (I), with that record being sent to all participants by end-of-day.
The reasoning being simple:

If anything of consequence was discussed in the meeting, then the official record is a valuable documentation (and the basis for the next meeting).

If nothing of consequence was discussed in the meeting, then the meeting was a waste of time and should never have taken place in the first place. Somebody wasn't prepared for the meeting they scheduled.

Like a good commit message, an official record as described above is cheap (doesn't take more than 2-3 minutes to write) and often delivers a fantastic ROI.

> If I'm calling a meeting, I'm sending out the agenda and meeting notes and expect the same of meetings I attend (and decline if there's no agenda sent beforehand).
Plus side is it really cuts down on pointless meetings since many times people just want to call meetings to avoid doing actual work, and with documentation responsibilities falling on the meeting caller, they have to do more work, not less.

Downside is the strong correlation between people who suck at meetings and people who suck at taking notes. Which can be pretty frustrating because you know who the pointless poorly run meeting people are, but you also can't rely on the notes if you skip.

> Some related advice on meetings, stolen from Getting Things Done: every point discussed in a meeting should result in one or more agreed and recorded next actions. This helps keep things clear, focused, and concrete.

> Let's assume your premise is true. What can we do to change this situation? Here are a few things which have helped me

1. Define Key Objectives for a Meeting

2. Define Agenda

3. Agenda has 4 parts - Topic, Owner, Expected Outcome, Duration, Time

4. Owner - The owner of the part of the agenda is expected to own the topic and drive it

5. Owner needs to pre-define the Expected Outcome beforehand. Broadly, there could be three outcomes - Information, Discussion or Decision

6. Moderator should keep a strict check on Time. Sometimes, if there's a overshoot - the moderator should either ask for team agreement to continue the topic for a limited time (10 min - for example) until the Expected Outcome is reached. If not, stop the meeting and move on the the next item on the Agenda.

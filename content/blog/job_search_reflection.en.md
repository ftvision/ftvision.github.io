# General requirements

After several successful and unsuccessful research and internship experiences, I think I wanna a position that has the following general features:

1. Intellectual Challenging Problems
2. Collaborative and Supportive Colleagues
3. Healthy, enriched personal growth and career developments
4. Real impacts on users, products, systems and companies

### Problem Solving

The problems are interesting, exciting, and challenging, so that I am excited to solve them and can feel sense of achievement for providing a solution.

*negative example*: I have encountered several trivial problems or very ill defined problems that I don't know what it is about. I am fine with open research, but I value a healthy feedback loop to narrow down the scopes and to refine problems.

### Collaborative working atmosphere

I can work collaboratively and independently. The key, however, is to have a supportive and collaborative team to work together, respectful and trustworthy, and organically combine collaborative and independent work. In such a team, I can get help from others as well as providing help to others. I can feel comfortable to ask and answer questions without feeling stupid or being looked down upon. This is a mutual commitment, between me and my co-worker. 

Feedback is also important.

Competition is fine, but I don't want to go to a team where most people full of sense of competition and undermine the idea that we can make it bigger if all of us working together. Understand the real competitor is people in other companies, not the one who work with you and want to make things better together. If teammates always treat each other as enemy, I don't feel comfortable working with them.

Also, I want to join a team where people really care about the quality of their work and are passionate about what they are doing.

*positive example*: I worked in a team where I can ask questions and my mentor always teach me patiently. Sometimes he also extends more than what I asked, and direct me to more references. I am encouraged to ask questions, and I am also encouraged to search more answers and learn more by my own before I turn to ask him. The interaction is very friendly and supportive, and I felt very comfortable to discuss my new ideas, to ask for suggestions, and to push things forward.

*negative example*: I worked in a team where I don't feel collaborative or supportive. Although asking questions are encouraged, I always find the feedbacks and interactions when asking questions are really uncomfortable. Either, I was told to think more, without guidance; or, I was told my explorations and trials are useless, even "shit". The interaction process frustrates me. It also makes me afraid of asking questions because I felt I am stupid and always ask wrong questions and making useless efforts. Very uncomfortable experience.  

### Personal Growth and Career developments

I want a job that can:

1. enhance my expertise
2. enable me to contribute my intelligence and skills
3. teach me new things that I don't know
4. give me a bigger picture of the field where I work (can be a gradual process)
5. realize my potential

*negative example*: I worked in a team in which I constantly feel I didn't learn new things, and cannot contribute at all. I kept making efforts and asking questions, but my feedbacks are my efforts are useless. I feel I cannot realize my potential in this team and I am unable to contribute my value in this team. I don't want someone throw me a project and let me figure it out but don't want to discuss with me.

### Real impacts

I want my work to have real impacts on users, products, systems, and companies. This is one major reason why I want to go industry and leave academia. I want to see what are the results and impacts of my work. If they are good, I want to make it better; if they are not good, I want to improve it. Such impacts can reinforce my sense of ownership of my work. I stand by the quality of my work and am willing to make it more influential, more helpful, more robust, more scalable.

*positive example:* I once made an AI system for a game and such a system brought a significant change for the game -- we don't even use human to direct the game during our daily game-playing event. Also, people use this system a lot and provide me feedbacks of the pros and cons of the system. I find such a work has a real impact on users and I feel very happy about it.

*negative example:* I have done a lot of research that end with going no where, neither published nor helping others. It makes me feel that I am wasting time and not making anything real.

# Reflecting My expertise

0. I am always willing to learn and I can learn very fast.
1. Have solid understanding of human vision, cognition, and cognitive psychology
2. Have very good background in algorithm and data-structure -- due to my competitive programming experiences
    1. could be stronger with Leetcode preparation
3. Mainly good at Python and C/C++
    1. Python now is the strongest [Still enhancing in multiple advanced aspects]
    2. C/C++ has working experiences, and can be stronger  
4. Very good Machine Learning and Statistics backgrounds
    1. Applied math degree
    2. Multiple hands-on projects and daily research experiences
    3. Has a good sense of different machine learning algorithms
    4. **CONS**: do not have many real-world experiences
5. Weakness:
    1. won't be able to start web-developing because don't have enough experiences in different frameworks, so cannot do full-stack web developing. **BUT I CAN LEARN.**
    2. still need to enhance SQL and/or map-reduce

I am a Software Engineer @ Citadel, New York, NY. Prior to that, I was a Software Engineer @ Google, Cambrdige, MA. I received my Ph.D. training from the Johns Hopkins University.

A few lines have accompanied me for years, the source of which I can't recall, but I'd like to share them here:

> Removing the delusion of a separate self and the desires it produces, and concentrating upon the subject until there is a direct communion with it.

> Successes are only rare spikes among background noises of failures in daily life. Achieving more successes comes from failing faster, failing more often, then learning more and keeping on.

## Who I Am

I am a Software Engineer at Citadel in New York, NY. Prior to that, I was a Software Engineer at Google in Cambridge, MA. I received my Ph.D. training in Cognitive Psychology from Johns Hopkins University.

This blog is a record of my thinking, covering technology, algorithms, cognitive science, and the intersections between them. I believe that thinking itself is an algorithm, and we can better understand the world and ourselves by understanding these algorithms.

## Core Philosophy

A few lines have accompanied me for years, the source of which I can't recall, but I'd like to share them here:

> Removing the delusion of a separate self and the desires it produces, and concentrating upon the subject until there is a direct communion with it.

> Successes are only rare spikes among background noises of failures in daily life. Achieving more successes comes from failing faster, failing more often, then learning more and keeping on.

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/feitong-yang-88088a55/) page contains similar professional information. [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=94Xx9u0AAAAJ) and [NeuroTree](http://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=65050) summarize my academic efforts and lineage.

Below is a list of pages where I describe myself in more detail. Honestly, my regular resume isn't particularly interesting, but the "failure resume" might be worth a look.

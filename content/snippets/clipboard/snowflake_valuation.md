  - Growth Rate is high: 121% year-over-year growth. 2x the 75% metrics of the companies with similar revenue. [Growth Banchmark](https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/24/how-fast-should-you-be-growing/)
  - Retention Rate is high: 158%. For every $1 of revenue Snowflake received from their customers a year ago, that same pool of customers are now paying $1.58. [Retention Benchmark](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/what-is-good-retention-issue-29)
  - Net promoter score (NPS) is a way of measuring customer satisfaction: 71. (Apple, 62; AirBnB: 42) [NPS Benchmark from satmetrix](https://www.satmetrix.com/infographic/2020-us-consumer-benchmarks/)
  - Average Contract Value
    - The average Snowflake customer pays Snowflake $165k a year. [Benchmark from  KBCM Technology Group](https://dskok-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-KBCM-SaaS-Survey.pdf): 29% of software businesses have an ACV between $50k-$250k, and only 9% have an ACV greater than $250k.
    - Snowflake has 56 customers that pay them over $1M a year
    - Capital One pays $29M.
  - Net Loss
    - Revenue under GAAP: Under GAAP, Snowflake doesn't count revenue when a customer pays them, but instead when a customer uses the Snowflake product.
      - As an example, let's say a customer purchases one year of Snowflake credits for $100k. That money winds up in Snowflake's bank account, but Snowflake cannot count that $100k as revenue until Snowflake delivers the service, which is when the customer uses their credits for compute time.
    - The thing is they are spending A LOT on sales and marketing.
      - Their total net loss for the last six months was $171M while during the same time period they spent $191M on sales and marketing.

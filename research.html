      <h2>Current Project: Spatial Representation</h2>
      <div class="content-section">
      <p>
        There are two basic computational problems in vision: What and Where. The former concerns object recognition; the latter concerns spatial localization. Spatial location is not only important in and of itself but is also essential for other visual computations. To name a few, motion perception calculates the direction and speed based on differences between locations at successive time points. Visual attention operates on spatial locations, selecting one place at a time. Visually guided action is derived from the understanding of the spatial location of objects and their parts, based on which appropriate motor responses are planned and executed. Lastly, object recognition also requires an understanding of the spatial configuration of different parts. For example, a scrambled face cannot be (and should not be) recognized as a face. <br>

        A spatial location becomes meaningful only when a reference frame is specified. For example, a location of (3,3) in the world is an undefined location. Only when a reference frame, such as a computer screen, is determined, and the origin and a coordinate system is specified, the location of (3,3) becomes well defined and refers to a specific location on the computer screen. As illustrate by this example, we need to understand in what reference frame a spatial location is represented. To understand a reference frame, we need to answer two important questions: The first question is the reference point question: in relation to what are locations defined. The second question is the format question: In what form are locations defined.

      <h2>Previous Research</h2>

        <h4>Statistical Learning</h4>
        <p>
          Human mind is a statistical machine that can extract the statistical regularities in the world 
        </p>
        <h4>Memory and Perception</h4>
        <p>
          Memory and perception are closely related. Previously, perception is thought to be a feedforward processing starting at retina. However, recent research has shown that perception would be integrated with what has already stored in memory.

        <h4>Perceptual Decision Making</h4>
        <p>
          Every perceptual experience is the result of a series of decision making. Perceptual decision-making concerns the problems of how perceptual system work in noisy environment, or with ambiguous stimuli.

      <h2>Current Project: Spatial Representation</h2>
      <div class="content-section">
      <p>
        There are two basic computational problems in vision: What and Where. The former concerns object recognition; the latter concerns spatial localization. Spatial location is not only important in and of itself but is also essential for other visual computations. To name a few, motion perception calculates the direction and speed based on differences between locations at successive time points. Visual attention operates on spatial locations, selecting one place at a time. Visually guided action is derived from the understanding of the spatial location of objects and their parts, based on which appropriate motor responses are planned and executed. Lastly, object recognition also requires an understanding of the spatial configuration of different parts. For example, a scrambled face cannot be (and should not be) recognized as a face. <br>

        A spatial location becomes meaningful only when a reference frame is specified. For example, a location of (3,3) in the world is an undefined location. Only when a reference frame, such as a computer screen, is determined, and the origin and a coordinate system is specified, the location of (3,3) becomes well defined and refers to a specific location on the computer screen. As illustrate by this example, we need to understand in what reference frame a spatial location is represented. To understand a reference frame, we need to answer two important questions: The first question is the reference point question: in relation to what are locations defined. The second question is the format question: In what form are locations defined.

      <h2>Previous Research</h2>

        <h4>Statistical Learning</h4>
        <p>
          structure is all around the world, and many of them are statistically defined. The knowledge of these statistical structure may help us adapt to the environments. For example, we know different vegetables are placed nearby in grocery stores. This spatial relationship help us find spinaches quickly when we see cauliflowers, despite huge differences between their shapes. Also, when listening to our favorite playlist, we can easy sing out the begining of the second song when we almost finish the first, because we know the temporal transitions between songs. The ability to learn these statistical structures is called statistical learning.

        <h4>Memory and Perception</h4>
        <p>
          How we perceive what we see? While Dr. James Gibson may say our visual system directly picks up the existed information in the world and thus we have the perception, I am more inclined to the idea that our perception is an inference process of what might be happening in the outside world. This unconscious inference view of perception can be dated back to Hermann von Helmholtz.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lots of factors shape our online perception. For example, our inherent brain structures set a constrain on what we can perceive. Additionally, our past experience affect what we see at present as well. All of these factors have a long lasting effects on our perception, but here I want to explore a different idea: **what is our mind right now affects what we perceive at present**. I want to explore the moment-to-moment change, or fluctuation, of perception. 
        </p>
        <h4>Perceptual Decision Making</h4>
        <p>
          Perception is full of uncertainty. Actually, each perception is a decision making task, we have to decide what is possibly out there in the world given the incoming visual inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          we set out to study how observers resolve uncertainties in perception and how training can help observers to cope with perceptual uncertainties. By using Glass Patterns, we manipulated the external uncertainy, uncertainty that can be attributed to noisy signals, and internal uncertainty, uncertainty that can be attributed to implicit decision criterion. Our fMRI results showed that different brain areas are responsible for different uncertainties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, we trained observers to cope with one kind of uncertainties repeatedly. We find that practicing internal uncertainty task can improve performances under both external and internal uncertainties, whereas practicing external uncertainty task can only improve performances under external uncertainty.

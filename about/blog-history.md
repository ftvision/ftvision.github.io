This blog has changed its appearance and its contents multiple times from 2014 till now. Although Github recored the commit history, it's not necessary to check back and revisit each previous version.

## Version 3 (2018/12 - Present)

Current Version is marked as the Version 3. In this blog, I intend to fill in more notes, thoughts, opinions, or other writings about mind and vision since this is still a topic I am interested, even though my daily job has nothing to do with it right now. At the same time, due to my own career development, I am trying to write things about programming and software engineering, such as C++ programming. This, of course, is a work in progress. I think the first challenge for me is to develop a process that can help to me write and update regularly.  

## Version 2 (2016/10 - 2018/12)
Version 2 of my blogs lasted until my Ph.D graduation. The homepage looks like the one below. This version used Jekyll's [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) and contained a little more information.

I tried again to organize my research and learning notes in this blog, but the project was too ambitious for me to finish. That being said, I have included the full draft of the literature review for my dissertation in the blog, as well as notes from several courses. I have made a good outline for all information that I intended to write in this blog, but the pressure of dissertation, job searching, and relocation prevented my from filling in the full contents. In the result, I only have written down several thoughts on how to learn programming and what materials are recommended for learning.

## Version 1 (2014/06 - 2016/10)

The first version was an experiment for me to learn how to use Jekyll to generate static pages for my own site. In this version, I tried to briefly described multiple research projects that I was working on, although none of the description included the details that I expected. Those projects, alas, did not go very far as well.

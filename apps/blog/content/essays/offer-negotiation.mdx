When it comes to negotiating job offers, there are several key resources and principles that can make a significant difference in the outcome. Here's a distillation of the most important lessons.

## Essential Reading

Before diving into negotiations, read these foundational articles:

<Marginnote>According to Quora estimates, it costs $12,000 to $24,000 to recruit an engineer in Silicon Valley. This gives you negotiating leverage — companies have already invested significantly to get to the offer stage.</Marginnote>

## Key Principles

### 1. Get Everything in Writing

Document everything: people, team, work responsibilities. Verbal agreements can be forgotten or misremembered.

### 2. Always Keep the Door Open

<Note>**Don't say:** "Yes, that sounds amazing, when do I start?" — This implicitly accepts the offer and completely closes the door on negotiation.</Note>

<Note>**Don't say:** "Can you do 90K instead of 85K?" — This also closes the door. They will just accept it and bargain against you using the anchoring effect.</Note>

Instead, try something like: *"Yeah, [COMPANY_NAME] sounds great! I really thought this was a good fit, and I'm glad that you guys agree. Right now I'm talking with a few other companies so I can't speak to the specific details of the offer until I'm done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I'm sure we'll be able to find a package that we're both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team."*

### 3. Information is Power

Do not disclose your cards too fast. Don't reveal your current salary, your minimum acceptable offer, or details about competing offers unless strategically advantageous.

### 4. Always Be Positive

Maintain a positive, collaborative tone throughout negotiations. You're working toward a mutually beneficial agreement, not fighting an adversary.

### 5. Don't Be the Decision Maker

Create some distance: *"I need to discuss it with my family/close friends/significant other."* Or: *"I just wanted to confirm I had all the details right."*

This gives you time to think and removes emotional pressure from real-time decisions.

### 6. Have Alternatives

When you receive an offer, often the first thing you should ask for is more time to make your decision. Especially in your first offer, more time is by far the most valuable thing you can ask for.

<Note>Having multiple offers or being in active interviews elsewhere significantly strengthens your position. If you don't have alternatives, you can still reference market rates: "Well, okay. I know that the average software engineer in Silicon Valley makes roughly 120K a year salary. So I think that's a good place to start."</Note>

### 7. Proclaim Reasons for Everything

Give specific, sympathetic reasons for your requests. The more unobjectionable your reason, the better. Medical expenses, student loans, family responsibilities — these bring context to your requests and make them harder to dismiss.

### 8. Be Motivated by More Than Just Money

Whatever you assert should be something you've touched on earlier in your discussions. Repeat it now as a gentle reminder. Companies appreciate candidates who care about the work, not just the paycheck.

### 9. Understand What They Value

Actually be motivated by other things. Understand what the company values and what flexibility they have:

- Sign-up bonus
- Equity
- Title
- Start date
- Remote work options
- Learning and development budget

### 10. Be Winnable

Make it clear that you can actually be won over. Nobody wants to negotiate with someone who seems impossible to satisfy.

### 11. Use Phone Over Email When Appropriate

While email gives you time to think, phone calls allow for more nuanced discussion. If you prefer email, you can say: *"I'd prefer to discuss the details of the offer over email. I sometimes get nervous during important phone calls, so discussing the offer over email helps me to keep a clear head and communicate more clearly. I hope this is okay with you."*

### 12. Change Your Mindset

Virtually any amount of money available to you personally is small change to your prospective employer. They've budgeted for roles at certain ranges and have flexibility built in.

<Note>**Critical timing:** Only negotiate salary after you have agreement in principle from someone with hiring authority that, if a mutually acceptable compensation can be agreed upon, you will be hired. Any discussion of compensation prior to hearing "Yes-If" is premature. If you're still at the job interview and you're talking price, you're doing something wrong.</Note>

## The Ideal Process

For much better results, your job search should look something like:

1. **Establish reputation** (optional but recommended) — Be known as someone who delivers measurable results vis-à-vis improving revenue or reducing costs.

2. **Direct connection** — Have a hiring manager talk with you specifically about an opening they want you specifically to fill.

3. **Informal discussions** — Talk informally (and then possibly formally) and come to the conclusion that this would be a great thing if both sides could come to a mutually fulfilling offer.

4. **Let them make the first offer** — Let them take a stab at what that mutually fulfilling offer would look like.

5. **Improve it** — Suggest ways they could improve it such that the path is cleared for you doing that voodoo that you do so well to improve their revenue and/or reduce their costs.

## Key Rules to Remember

1. **Never Give A Number First**
2. **Listen To What People Tell You. Repeat It Back To Them.**
3. **Research, Research, Research**
4. **New Information Is Valuable And Can Be Traded For Things You Want**
5. **You Have A Multi-Dimensional Preference Set. Use It.**

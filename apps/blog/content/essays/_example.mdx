# Understanding Design Systems

This is an example essay that demonstrates the full capabilities of the blog's content system.

## Introduction

Design systems are collections of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

## Key Concepts

### Tokens

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes.

```typescript
// Example token usage
const primaryColor = tokens.color.action.primary;
const spacing = tokens.spacing.md;
```

### Components

Components are the reusable building blocks of the system.

## Benefits of Design Systems

1. **Consistency** - Ensures visual and behavioral consistency across products
2. **Efficiency** - Reduces duplicate work and speeds up development
3. **Scalability** - Makes it easier to maintain and scale design decisions
4. **Collaboration** - Creates a shared language between designers and developers

## Conclusion

A well-implemented design system is an investment that pays dividends over time.

## Mathematics

It is hard; it is interesting. It is philosophical; it is practical; It is concrete; it is abstract. It is intuitive; it is counterintuitive. It is everything, it is nothing.

## Programming

Programming is to tell the computer how to work step by step. Learning a programming language is not really hard. Just list the steps you want the computers to do. Mastering a programming language, however, is a completely different thing. The former may take only a week, the latter could take a decade.

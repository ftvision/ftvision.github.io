Not every note on this site is organized. I usually first put all the materials here, in a messy format. Then, I take time to organize my notes, to think, and to rewrite my notes. [Here](/note_progress) is a list of progresses.

## Vision, Mind, and Brain

How does the mind work? What is the relationship between our mind and our brain?

| Pattern Perception | How does visual system perceive global patterns |
| [Eye Movement](/eye_movement) | Features, theories, and experiments of eye movements |
| Computational Theory of Mind | Understand the mind and its computations |

## Mathematics

It is hard; it is interesting. It is philosophical; it is practical; It is concrete; it is abstract. It is intuitive; it is counterintuitive. It is everything, it is nothing.

## Programming

Programming is to tell the computer how to work step by step. Learning a programming language is not really hard. Just list the steps you want the computers to do. Mastering a programming language, however, is a completely different thing. The former may take only a week, the latter could take a decade.

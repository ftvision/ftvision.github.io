Visual Perception, Visual Attention, Visual Cognition, Perceptual Decision Making

## Current Project: Spatial Representation

This project investigates the visual spatial representation, with a focus on location representations. In this project, I mainly study the reference frames in vision and the formats of different reference frames. This is my thesis project, therefore I will updates the thesis proposal as well as the final dissertation as the project progresses.

## Previous Research

### Statistical Learning

We live in an environment full of statistical structures and regularities. Structured sounds construct speech and music whereas structure-less sounds construct noise. Structure images form movies and pictures whereas structure-less images form snow-like noise on TV. These regularities are essential for us to acquire knowledge, organize environmental information and ultimately adapt our behavior for survival. The ability to learn these statistical regularities is termed as **statistical learning**.

### Memory and Perception

How we perceive what we see? While Dr. James Gibson may say our visual system directly picks up the existed information in the world and thus we have the perception, I am more inclined to the idea that our perception is an inference process of what might be happening in the outside world. This unconscious inference view of perception can be dated back to Hermann von Helmholtz.

Lots of factors shape our online perception. For example, our inherent brain structures set a constrain on what we can perceive. Additionally, our past experience affect what we see at present as well. All of these factors have a long lasting effects on our perception, but here I want to explore a different idea: **what is our mind right now affects what we perceive at present**. I want to explore the moment-to-moment change, or fluctuation, of perception.

### Perceptual Decision Making


Perception is full of uncertainty. Actually, each perception is a decision making task, we have to decide what is possibly out there in the world given the incoming visual inputs.

we set out to study how observers resolve uncertainties in perception and how training can help observers to cope with perceptual uncertainties. By using Glass Patterns, we manipulated the external uncertainy, uncertainty that can be attributed to noisy signals, and internal uncertainty, uncertainty that can be attributed to implicit decision criterion. Our fMRI results showed that different brain areas are responsible for different uncertainties.

Later, we trained observers to cope with one kind of uncertainties repeatedly. We find that practicing internal uncertainty task can improve performances under both external and internal uncertainties, whereas practicing external uncertainty task can only improve performances under external uncertainty.

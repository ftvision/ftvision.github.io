	<article> <p>Perception is full of uncertainty. Actually, each perception is a decision making task, we have to decide what is possibly out there in the world given the incoming visual inputs.</p>

<p>We set out to study how observers resolve uncertainties in perception and how training can help observers to cope with perceptual uncertainties. By using Glass Patterns, we manipulated the external uncertainy, uncertainty that can be attributed to noisy signals, and internal uncertainty, uncertainty that can be attributed to implicit decision criterion. Our fMRI results showed that different brain areas are responsible for different uncertainties.</p>

<p>Later, we trained observers to cope with one kind of uncertainties repeatedly. We find that practicing internal uncertainty task can improve performances under both external and internal uncertainties, whereas practicing external uncertainty task can only improve performances under external uncertainty.</p>

	<h1>Post: Obsolete Self-introduction</h1>
	<div id="content">
	<p>I am an introverted guy drowing in my own world. My inner world is much more colorful than the outside world I am experiencing. But every once in a while, I intentionally step out of my comfortable zone and try something named "extraverted". When my power is off, I need to stay alone, concentrate on my inner world and regain my energy. It is the "exploration-exploite" trade-off.</p>

<p>I am a language fan. The best thing I've done during my undergraduate is that I tasted several languages. They are all delicious, though some are hard to digest. I will keep on learning languages during my graduate life, or my whole life in the future. I am interested in the language phenomena that make each language unique. Currently, however, I can only fluently speak Chinese and English.</p>

<p>I am establishing my personal philosophy. It's HARD! In fact, my personal philosophy is in chaos; I wish to achieve enlightment but I am not strictly practicing -  I even have no great idea what to practice. Well, I just let it be, let my heart feel and my brain calculate. I believe in unconscious computation, our brain's fascinating ability. So, someday, when the calculation has finished, I will have my ideas. No worries. Carpe Diem!</p>

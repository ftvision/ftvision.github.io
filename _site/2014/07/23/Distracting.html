<p>One of the reason that I waste my time is because I don’t want to do the current work. Yes, it is procrastination. By this force, I actively dodge the work I should take, and they seem not interesting enough for me to take actions. 最重要的是我刷renren什么的不需要动脑子，只是简单的浏览。但是阅读其他任何东西都有一种“想要获取一些什么东西，想要学到写什么东西”的功利冲动。功利性太强的结果是觉得做事情的时候没有获得点什么总觉得是在浪费时间</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Make the project smaller and specify intermediate goal. I find that prioirty cannot be leveled up simply by thinking something is important. The way to prioritize something is to make something doable. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>train the concentration time: keep concentrated for a period of time and try to shut up all the incoming information during that time. This is to work with papers. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not look ahead. Looking ahead sometimes make me desparate because I still have a lot left. </p>

<p>Another reason is because I fyeel tired and cannot stay awake. I may go back to bed and fall asleep, or directly fall asleep on the table.</p>

    <p>1) Do not work in bed or lying on the bed. </p>

    <p>2) Have regular rest. I need to learn the quick-charging method. </p>

<p>I have no patience to finish a big project, no matter whether it is my research project or life project. This indicates that I lack of the ability of project management. Problems include that I don’t know what projects are going. It seems very hard for me to know what exactly projects are going right now I always add or drop projects with no efficient track. </p>

<p>I am still over optimized my ability of running projects at the same time. This is also due to my obssess of hard-working. The mismatch of my ability and the single-minded belief in hard working, always resulted in a long-time period of running away from some projects or awful procrastination. </p>

<p>For each project:
1) Do I want to do
2) How much do I want to do
3) If my performance is mediocre, is that OK
4) What is it’s priority
5) Any reward or penalty?
6) </p>

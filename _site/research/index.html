<h1><a name="principle">Principles</a></h1>

<p><strong>First Principle</strong>: <span style="color:red">I do science for fun. Precisely, I only do science when I feel happy. </span></p>

<p>As you may know, this whimsical First Principle causes a lot of headaches to my advisor, and back to me as well, before we get along with each other (Li, 2014). Well, it takes time to play a good tango together. God bless Jon and me. </p>

<p>Ideally, I do <a href="/thought/2014/07/11/research-deserve-to-do.html">two kinds of research</a>. However, in a baby scientist's growth, lots of trivial, messy studies are inevitable. Hence, running control experiments becomes my featured interest (Flombaum, 2014).</p>

<h1><a name="ancestry">Bloodline</a></h1>

<p>Academic bloodline not only tells about where am I from, but also tells about my approaches to asking and answering questions. Years of training under specific advisors' supervision shapes who I am and where I am. </p>

<p><a href="http://pbs.jhu.edu/research/flombaum/facultyinfo/">Jonathan Flombaum</a> runs the <a href="www.jhuvisualthinkinglab.com">visual thinking lab</a> in Johns Hopkins University where I started my apprenticeship from 2013. This intelligent New Yorker has his own pride and prejudice. He cares deeply about algorithms used by human mind. However, it remains mysterious whether or not he is interested in how brain works and implements algorithms. We are developing our relationship.  </p>

<p>Sheng Li runs the Computation and Cognition Lab in Peking University where I stayed from 2009 to 2013. He came from Computer Science background and started revealing human brain mechanism when he worked with Zoe Kourtzi. This Scorpian was my Academic and Life mentor during my stay in his lab. He indeed knew me inside out. </p>

	<article> <p>Structure is all around the world, and many of them are statistically defined. The knowledge of these statistical structure may help us adapt to the environments. For example, we know different vegetables are placed nearby in grocery stores. This spatial relationship help us find spinaches quickly when we see cauliflowers, despite huge differences between their shapes. Also, when listening to our favorite playlist, we can easy sing out the begining of the second song when we almost finish the first, because we know the temporal transitions between songs. The ability to learn these statistical structures is called statistical learning.</p>

<p>In this project, I try to explore some basic features of statistical learning.</p>

<p>The take home is: statistical learning is fast and robust.</p>

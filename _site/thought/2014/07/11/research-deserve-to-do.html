	<h1>Post: Good research to do</h1>
	<div id="content">
	<p>There are lots of limitations in doing research: money, time, and most important, laziness. You won't do every experiment that comes to your mind. Sharing the ideas, or pride, with my colleagues, I prefer to spend my time and money in doing good research. Two kinds of research I would do: one solves an important question, the other shows my intelligence. Significant or smart.</p>

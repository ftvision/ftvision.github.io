# Hello World!
<img src="/images/profile1.jpg" alt="profile" id="profile" />

## Details
I am a PhD <sub>(a.k.a. Pure-Hilarious-Diverse, Permanent-Head-Damage, or Perilous-Hazardous-Despairing) </sub>student studying human vision at Johns Hopkins University. I just wrapped up my first year study during which I experimented on visual working memory\'s modulation on perception, statistical learning, figure-ground perception and attention. I am  drowing in my transition period right now. Outside of research, I travel, watch animations and learn new languages. \[[Obsolete Self Introduction is Here]({% post_url 2014-07-11-Obsolete-Self-Introduction %})\]

## Diversity in Appearance
Picture never tells the truth. The profile photo above will not help you recognize me on the street. Here are two more photos to help you extrapolate my appearance because my hair-style changes a lot. More importantly, if you keep the left photo in mind, you\'ll feel my hair is shorter in the photo above; if you keep the right photo in mind, you\'ll feel my hair is longer in the photo above. For more details, refer to my research, :D

### Curvature in human saccadic trajectory

When it comes to rapid eye-movements, or saccades, one might expect a ballistic trajectory that goes along the shortest distance between two fixation points. Contrary to this expectation, human eye movements are rarely straight. For example, one early report from Yarbus (1967) wrote that *“saccades performed at an angle ... are most frequently recorded as curved lines”* (Van der Stigchel, Meeter, and Theeuwes, 2006). 

#### Commonality in saccades

The curvature in saccades is so prevailing, especially in oblique saccades, that Smit and Van Gisbergen (1990) described dynamic properties of saccade curvature as a *"signature"*.  The curvature appears in many kinds of tasks. For example, Smit and Van Gisbergen (1990) have shown that memory-guided saccades are curved in a similar way as visually-guided saccades do, though the memory-guided ones are slower and more variable.

#### Variability in curvature

There is also a lot of variability in the curvature of trajectories. The direction and the amount of curvature clearly varied from subjects to subject, and from trial to trial in the same subject (Becker and Jürgens, 1990; Van der Stigchel, Meeter, and Theeuwes, 2006). In all saccades, horizontal and vertical saccades are usually straight, although vertical saccades vary a lot and have more curvature (Becker and Jürgens, 1990). The oblique saccades are always curved. 

#### Differences in species


- Humans seem to have the most curved trajectories and the most disparity in timing (e.g. Bahill and Stark 1975, 1977; King et al. 1986, Grossman  & Robinson, 1988) 
- Monkeys clearly have trajectories that are usually straight; this seems to support a polar-coordinate model (van Gisbergen et al. 1985), but a Cartesian-coordinate model can also explain (see **models**).
- Cats seem to fall somewhere in between (Guitton and Mandl 1980; Evinger et al. 1981).

#### Oblique saccades

Constrained by eye-muscules, every saccade could be decomposed into a vertical sub-component and a horizontal sub-component. Horizontal saccades are created by medium-lead burst neurons (MLB) in the paramedian pontine reticular formation: these neurons project to internuclear neurons and motoneurons innervating the lateral and medial rectus muscles. Vertical saccades are generated by MLB in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus that lies in the midbrain; these cells project to motoneurons innervating the vertical recti and oblique muscles (Grossman and Robinson, 1988).

The horizontal and vertical sub-components of an oblique have several features:

1. Oblique saccades showed an early dominance of the horizontal velocity signal. Thus, such saccades show trajectories curving away from the horizontal axis. (Smit and Van Gisbergen, 1990)
1. The smaller sub-component may start later or terminate earlier than the larger sub-component. (King, Lisberger, and Fuchs, 1986)
1. The smaller sub-component of an oblique saccade has a lower velocity than purely horizontal or vertical saccades of the same size, and its duration is stretched so as to approach that of the larger component (Becker and Jürgens,1990).
1. The sub-components have different latencies to peak velocity and different durations, and the sub-component velocities were weakly correlated only (Becker and Jürgens,1990).

#### Curvature and Landing Point

**The landing point seems to have no relationship with curvature** (Walker, McSorley, & Haggard, 2006; see also Port & Wurtz, 2003), and the processes are different  in selecting the goal for the saccade and in determining the trajectory (Port & Wurtz, 2003; Quaia et al., 1999). 

Thomas and O'Beirne (1967) suggest that the new fixation points are computed independently in the brain, which sends input signals to the overall oculomotor system, and oculomotor control system passes the signals to different muscles with different delays, thus forming the actual trajectories. Feedbacks are also involved in the oculomotor system to execute the trajectory. 

### Models of human saccades 

What is of interest here is how a central command to make an oblique saccade is translated into commands delivered to the vertical and horizontal circuits 

#### Model summary: Cartesian model v.s. Polar model

Grossman and Robinson (1988) have summarized two possible models:

- In a **Cartesian coordinate** model, the central command for the oblique saccade is broken down into horizontal and vertical components before pulse generation. In this case, the horizontal and vertical pulse generators are driven by horizontal and vertical motor error, respectively. Thus, if one component is much different than the other, the trajectory of the oblique saccade would be curved, since the smaller component would end earlier.
- In a **Polar Coordinate** mode,  the angle of the oblique motor error $\theta$ and its oblique amplitude is coded somewhere before pulse generation. The output of the pulse generator would be a command for oblique eye velocity at the angle $\theta$. Neural circuitry would then convert this into a signal multiplied by $\cos\theta$ for the horizontal system and a signal multiplied by $\sin\theta$ for the vertical.


![Grossman_Robinson_1988](assets/img/notes/cognition/models.png)

Derived from these two main categories, different models have different implementation details and hypotheses.

##### 1. Independent Source Model (Cartesian)

The independent model (Bahill and Stark 1975, 1977) proposes the existence of four independent pulse generators which generate eye velocity signals along the cardinal axes (right or left; up or down) so that oblique saccade sub-components of a given size always have the same dynamics, regardless of overall saccade direction (Smit and Van Gisbergen,1990). 

If this is the case,  as reasoned by Becker and Jürgens (1990),  there should be “superfast” oblique saccades since the peak velocities of both components would reach the same asymptotic maximum as horizontal saccades so that the vectorial velocity could become about $\sqrt{2}$ times of the velocity of horizontal saccades. Experimental observations, such as in Gisbergen et al. (1985) and King et al. (1986), have never found such cases. Results in Bahill and Stark (1975, 1977), however, seemed to be based on a sample of saccades with vector amplitudes less than 5 deg.

##### 2. Common Source Model (Polar)

The saccadic system could first specify a vectorial velocity command signal whose peak velocity and duration depend on vector size. The component control signals are subsequently derived from this common signal by trigonometric decomposition. 

If this is the base, oblique saccade components should always have equal durations and yield straight saccade trajectories (Van Gisbergen et al. 1985, Becker and Jürgens, 1990). King, Lisberger, and Fuchs (1986) tested both human and monkey, and they found supporting evidence that 

1. Duration of the horizontal components was proportional to the vector amplitude of the saccade rather than to the component amplitude. 
2. Duration of the horizontal and vertical sub-components of primate oblique saccades was nearly equal. Consequently, the shorter components had longer durations than expected from their amplitudes alone.
3. The peak velocities of stretched sub-components generally did fall below the mean peak velocities of pure horizontal or vertical saccades of the same size

Other observations of oblique human saccades disagreed with such the model prediction. For example, Viviani et al (1977) found that smaller horizontal velocity component has the earlier onset than the vertical one. Viviani et al (1977) also showed a systematic dominance of the horizontal component over the vertical one which is independent of the initial gaze position and amplitude.

##### 3. Coupling Model (Cartesian)

Grossman and Robinson (1988) have proposed a version of the Independent Source Model with cross-coupled pulse generators where the summed activity in the up and down pulse generators tunes down the gain in each of the horizontal pulse generators, and vice versa. In particular, a large burst in one system would turn down the gain of the other to slow and stretch its saccade. Because each component slows the other, the peak velocity along the straight oblique path is slightly less than the peak velocity for the same amplitude of a purely horizontal or vertical saccade (Grossman and Robinson, 1988).

By tuning the cross-coupling factor, which determines the amount of gain reduction between sub-components, this model can produce the same results as a Polar model would predict. Thus the model is mainly a disproof by counter-example. The claim disproved is that because monkey saccadic trajectories arc usually straight and a large component stretches a small one, the polar coordinate theory must be true (van Gisbergen et al. 1985). 

##### 4. Model Comparison


No model can capture the human saccade data very well.

For example, in the study of Becker and Jürgens (1990),  data do not fully support the view of Van Gisbergen et al. (1985) and King et al. (1986) that oblique saccades have the same velocity (in the vectorial sense) as cardinal ones; data also did not show oblique saccades that reach the "superfast" velocities expected under the "independent source" assumption. In a qualitative sense, cross-coupling model seems to be more satisfactory in that it can account for the fact that saccade curvature depends systematically on saccade direction.

### Attention and curvature


For saccades to a target in presence of distractors, their trajectories sometimes curve towards distractors, and sometimes curve away from distractors. Both task-relevant and task-irrelevant information can contribute to the curvature (Doyle and Walker, 2001).  Differences in the direction of saccade deviation (toward or away from distractors) does not depend on species (humans/monkeys), the mode of saccade generation (voluntary/reflexive), or saccade direction (Walker, McSorley, & Haggard, 2006). Instead, it is the environmental determinants that modify the idiosyncratic saccade trajectories (Van der Stigchel, Meeter, and Theeuwes, 2006). 

#### Paradigms


Several experimental paradigms are used to study how do environmental determinants affect saccadic curvature. In all of these paradigms, a central fixation cross is presented at the start of the trial, and participants are required to saccade to the location of a target that appears abruptly in the visual display (‘an abrupt onset’).
 
- Double-step paradigm
  - **Manipulation**: a second target appear after the first target, with various delay. 
  - **Results:** 
    - If the delay between the onset of the first and the second target is relatively short (i.e. 50 ms, Van Gisbergen et al., 1987) and the distance between the two targets is large (i.e. 408, Van Gisbergen et al., 1987), the eye movement trajectory is influenced.
    - Specifically, initially the saccade is executed to the first target location but changes its direction mid-flight and lands in the direction of the second target location (so-called ‘turn-around saccades’) 
- Global effect paradigm
  - **Manipulation**:  a target and an irrelevant distractor element are placed close to each other
  - **Results:** 
    - saccade trajectories curved towards to the irrelevant distractor
    - these findings support a ‘center of gravity’ account, which states that the saccade endpoint is based on the relative saliency of the elements in the saccade map 
- Visual search paradigm
  - **Manipulation**: search for a target among distractors, 
  - **Results**: 
    - the trajectories are influenced by the presence of distractors.
    - the trajectories may curve away or towards distractors
    - the trajectories may also show a mid-light, or turn-around, trajectory (e.g. McPeek, Skavenski,  and Nakayama, 2000). 

#### Curve Away from Distractors

##### 1. Phenomenon

Doyle and Walker (2001) have shown that both reflexive and voluntary saccades curved away from irrelevant distractors. In their experiments, saccade direction is specified by a task-informative cue.  Subjects direct their attention to the peripheral cue, discriminate the direction specified and then make a saccade to the appropriate target. When attention is directed to the left, saccades curve to the right, and when attention is directed to the right, saccades curve to the left. The curvature is greatest when the saccade target is in the same (upper v.s. lower) hemifield as the distractor.

Doyle and Walker (2002) also found multisensory distractors may affect the curvature of saccades in a similar way: saccade trajectories showed strong leftward curvature following right-side distractors and showed rightward curvature following left-side distractors. The largest effects on trajectories were observed for visual distractors, but significant curvature was observed with auditory and somatosensory distractors. Both voluntary and reflexive saccades were found to curve away from task-irrelevant visual distractors, but auditory and somatosensory task-irrelevant distractors did not modulate saccade trajectories.   

![Doyle_Walker_2001](assets/img/notes/cognition/curve_away.png)

##### 2. Hypothetical Mechanisms

1.  Active inhibition:
  - Active inhibition of distractors caused the saccade to the target to deviate away from the attended location. Such process inhibits distractor-related activity below baseline level prior to saccade initiation (Doyle & Walker, 2001, 2002; McSorley et al., 2004; Sheliga et al., 1994; Sheliga, Riggio, & Rizzolatti, 1995; Tipper, Howard, & Houghton, 2000; Tipper et al., 2001,  [McSorley, Haggard, & Walker, 2006]).
  - Although such an inhibitory mechanism is able to account for the behavioral data, there is no direct neurophysiological evidence for such a process.
1. GABA agonist in collicular motor map
  -  McSorley, Haggard, & Walker (2006) suggested that the link between inhibition and curvature away from distractors is supported by reversible deactivation studies in which a localized injection of a GABA agonist is placed at a location in the collicular motor map. The result of this localized increase in inhibition is the deviation of saccades in the direction away from the location represented by the injection site (Aizawa & Wurtz, 1998; Quaia, Aizawa, Optican, & Wurtz, 1998). 
  - but no such behavior has been observed in monkeys without pharmacological deactivation (Van der Stigchel, Meeter, and Theeuwes, 2006)
1. Over-compensation:
  - observers, to prevent deviation towards the location, plan a saccade in the opposite direction, which generally overcompensates and leads to deviation away from the attended or distractor location (Van der Stigchel, Meeter, and Theeuwes, 2006).
1. Top-down preparation:
  - McSorley, Haggard, & Walker (2006) suggested also when top-down preparation can influence the target selection processes, deviation away can be observed.

#### Curve Towards Distractors

##### 1. Phenomenon

When there was strong competition between target and distractor stimuli (due to color priming from previous trials), subjects were more likely to make a saccade to a distractor. Such error saccades were often followed, after a very short inter-saccadic interval (􏰌10–100 ms), by a second saccade to the target (McPeek, Skavenski, and Nakayama, 2000). For example, when the distractor color on the current trial was strongly primed (e.g. a red distractor in a trial which was preceded by several trials in which the target was red), subjects tended to make an initial saccade to the distractor. Such incorrect saccades were followed, often after a very brief fixation, by a second saccade to the correct target. 

##### 2. Mechanisms
 
1. Population coding in the superior colliculus (Van der Stigchel, Meeter, & Theeuwes, 2006; Walker, McSorley, and Haggard, 2006; Tipper et al. 2001).
  - **Background:** Activity of populations of neurons in SC's intermediate layers is thought to operate as a two-dimensional motor map encoding the metrics of potential saccade goals (Sparks & Hartwich-Young, 1989; Wurtz, Basso, Paré, & Sommer, 2000). Possible target objects are represented by a large population of neurons that encode the movement towards each target object as a vector. Deviation toward distractors has been explained in terms of partial activation of the saccade program associated with the distractor, followed by an averaging process within the motor map encoding saccade metrics
  - Neurophysiological support for this account has been provided in the literature. McPeek et al. (2003) have recorded single-neuron responses in the SC and showed that curvature toward a distractor location was associated with the increased activity of neurons encoding the distractor observed just prior to saccade onset (see also McPeek & Keller, 2001). Port and Wurtz (2003) investigated saccade trajectories in a double-step paradigm. Trials in which turn-around saccades occurred were accompanied by initial high activity at the distractor location, with a later shift towards the target location. Such an effect was absent for straight saccades.
  - In addition, subthreshold microstimulation of collicular sites, prior to saccade onset, was found to produce curvature toward the stimulated location. 

To summarize, deviation towards seems to be caused by unresolved competition between elements in a visual scene. If competition between possible target locations is not yet resolved at the time of the saccade, deviation towards is frequently observed (Van der Stigchel, Meeter, & Theeuwes, 2006; Walker, McSorley, and Haggard, 2006).

#### Away versus Towards

What conditions make saccade trajectories curved towards distractors and what make trajectories curved away from distractors? 

On average, saccade trajectories curved toward distractors when target locations were unpredictable and curved away from distractors when target locations were known in advance. There was no overall difference in mean saccade latencies or amplitude between the two conditions (Walker, McSorley, and Haggard, 2006).

- **Unpredictable target:** With unpredictable targets, saccades curved toward distractor locations when latency was short and became less curved as latency increased, with curvature away from distractors being observed for the slowest 20% of saccades. 
- **Predictable target:** With predictable targets, saccades deviated away from the distractor across all latency intervals.

Walker, McSorley, and Haggard, (2006) hypothesized that the direction of curvature (toward or away from distractors) reflects preparatory tuning of the oculomotor system when the location of the target and distractor are known in advance. The consequence is that the intensity of the competition between target and distractor is greater when target location is predictable and, so, distractor-related activity is more likely to be suppressed below baseline prior to saccade initiation. Prior to target and distractor onset, inhibition is assumed to be applied equally to all potential distractor sites. Once the distractor location is made apparent (following stimulus onset), inhibition can then be lifted from other potential distractor locations and applied more firmly to the distractor itself. Selection may involve local competitive inhibition between target and distractor locations in the neural map, leading to gradual suppression of the distractor location (Port and Wurtz 2003; Walton et al. 2005). 
 
#### Straighten the Trajectory 

When multiple distractors appear simultaneously, saccade trajectories could be strengthened by distractors on two sides.

For example, McSorley, Haggard, and Walker (2004) placed two mirror or non-mirror symmetrical distractors on two sides of the target. 

![McSorley_etal_2004](assets/img/notes/cognition/mirror_distractors.png)

Observers in this study need to saccade vertically up or down to a target, where one or two distractors were placed on the side. Compared with saccade-to-target trajectories when only one distractor was presented, trajectories are less curved when two distractors were presented, one on each side of the target. Both mirror and non-mirror symmetrical distractors can help to straighten the trajectories. Additionally, such straightened trajectories are comparable to those trajectories when no distractor was presented. From these results, McSorley et al (2004) reasoned that the distractor modulation of saccade trajectory is not highly spatially specific and that it can be balanced by a second bilateral distractor in the opposite visual field. 

### the turn-around saccades

A saccade can initially be executed to one location but mid-flight turn around and land at a second location (Van Gisbergen et al., 1987; Amador et al., 1998; Van der Stigchel, Meeter, and Theeuwes, 2006). Some studies have found a very short inter-saccade interval between at the turn-around phase, whereas others have found no clear inter-saccade interval during the turning.

##### Neurological-induced turn-around saccades 

Neurophysiologists have shown that interrupting a saccade in mid-flight can be accomplished by stimulating sites in the omnipause region of the brainstem (OPNs: Keller, 1977) or in the rostral superior colliculus (SC: Munoz & Wurtz, 1993).  

##### Turn-around saccades in visual search task

In a visual search task, on the trials in which the initial saccade was directed toward a distractor, subjects often executed a second, corrective, saccade toward the target after a very short latency (10 – 100 ms) (McPeek, Skavenski, and Nakayama, 2000).

![McPeek_etal_2000](assets/img/notes/cognition/turn_around.png)

The fact that a second saccade can be executed so quickly after the end of an initial saccade leads the authors to speculate that the second saccade may have been programmed concurrently with the first saccade. 

One view, put forward by Becker and Jurgens (1979) and Hou and Fender (1979) is that saccade preparation is a two-stage process: in the first stage, saccade direction is fixed, while in a later stage, saccade amplitude is determined. Thus, newly-arriving visual information can affect saccade amplitude but is unable to change saccade direction. 

McPeek, Skavenski, and Nakayama, (2000) proposed that concurrent processing of a second saccade goal interferes the initial saccade during the preparation and execution of the initial saccade. First, the process of programming an initial saccade toward a distractor (presumably due to priming of the distractor color) begins. After a certain amount of time, new information, providing the correct location of the target, reaches the system. This triggers the preparation of a second saccade directed toward the target, which proceeds in parallel with the programming and execution of the first saccade. 

1. This concurrent processing of the second saccade is supported by the observations that the accuracy of the second saccade is not correlated with the duration of the inter-saccadic interval.  
2. The **interference** is supported by the observations that the amplitudes of the initial saccades were smaller than normal, and there was a clear relationship between the amplitude reduction of the initial saccade and the brevity of the inter-saccadic interval.

**Caution:** there is no clear definition of when a saccade is a turn-around saccade and when it is ‘just’ deviating towards a distractor. A saccade that turns around mid-flight can be seen as deviating towards the initial saccade goal (Van der Stigchel, Meeter, and Theeuwes, 2006)

##### Turn-around in anti-saccade research 

In addition to attention research, the "turn-around" saccadic pattern is also observed in other research, such as anti-saccade research (Amador, Schlag-Rey, & Schlag, 1998).

The anti-saccade task requires observers to saccade to the opposite location to the target. For example, when a target is presented on the left, observers need to saccade to the right of the same distance. One Interesting phenomenon in such task is that saccades to the stimulus could be followed by appropriate antisaccades with no intersaccadic interval. Such instances are here referred to as ‘‘turnaround saccades.’’ Such instances were never reinforced and therefore remained quite rare (<1% of the observed data) (Amador, Schlag-Rey, & Schlag, 1998).

Also, turnaround saccades occurred only after the monkeys learned to some extent the relevance of the instruction cue.  As antisaccade performance improved, turnaround saccades tended to be replaced by two distinct saccades, separated by an increasing intersaccadic interval  (Amador, Schlag-Rey, & Schlag, 1998).

### Corrective saccades

Goal-directed vertical and oblique saccades, like those in the horizontal direction, are generally followed by one or more corrective saccades. For horizontal saccades, latency for a corrective saccade depends on the size of the fixation error left after the first main  saccade (Becker, 1972; Henson, 1978) The latency decreases from values of order of 200-300 ms for small errors (~1 deg) to an asymptotic minimum of 120-160 ms for large errors (Becker and Jürgens, 1990). 

### Fish-hook pattern in saccades

A "fish hook" pattern at the end of a saccade is first reported by Thomas and O'Beirne (1967), who asked observers to saccade to a target in one of eight directions. The targets are five degrees away from the fixation. Observers may saccade from the fixation to a target or from a target to the fixation; thus, there are 16 conditions in total.

In this task, typical trajectories in eight conditions had one feature in common: towards the end of the movement, they showed a hook to the left (Thomas and O'Beirne, 1967), as shown in the figure below. 

![fish_hook_1967.jpg](assets/img/notes/cognition/fish_hook_1967.png)

When considering the factors that cause such a fish-hook feature, Thomas and O'Beirne (1967) reasoned that this is because the extraocular muscles are not innervated simultaneously. From the perspective of neuroanatomy, it is likely that the lateral rectus contracting late, because the sixth nerve that controls this muscle, the abducens nerve, has its nuclei more caudally (about 25 mm) to the nuclei of the 3rd and 4th nerves that control the other ocular muscles (Thomas and O'Beirne, 1967). This hypothesis, however, seems to fail to support later observations (see Viviani, Berthoz, Tracey, 1977)

Interestingly, the fish-hook feature here are rare in left-ward and in relatively straight saccades (6,7 in Fig.2 left; 1,2,3,4,6 in Fig.2 right), but the authors suggested that the delay of lateral rectus still exists, but is masked by the nature of the movement.  

Bahill and Stark (1975, 1977, 1979) have observed the same "fish-hook" feature in saccades in less constrained conditions. They asked observed to perform different oblique saccades and found multiple cases of the "fish-hook" feature at the end of the saccades. They mainly took this feature, together with the curvature in saccadic trajectory, as evidence for the independent horizontal and vertical components in saccade execution.

![fish_hook_1967.jpg](assets/img/notes/cognition/fish_hook_1979.png)

Later, this "fish hook" feature is rarely reported. In fact, most saccade research did not observe such feature. For example,  Smit and Van Gisbergen (1990) reported that the fishhook-shaped trajectories were rare in their material, and they suggest that such feature may only be observed in small saccades within 5 degrees (Smit and Van Gisbergen, 1990). 

More recently, Amador,  Schlag-Rey, and Schlag (1998) reported one case in monkey saccade research that one monkey shows an upward drift at the end of saccades when the monkey performs a task in the completely dark room, shown in the figure below. Another monkey, who is in the same study but in an illuminated environment, did not show such feature. 

![fish_hook_1967.jpg](assets/img/notes/cognition/upward_shift_1998.png)

I have found no more recent research that reports, discusses, or studies such "fish hook" feature.


#### Appendix A: parameters of saccades

In this Appendix, I summarize how to calculate many parameters when we study saccadic trajectories. Most parameters are calculated in the same way in all literature. Some parameters have different calculations.

##### 1. Amplitude

Amplitude was defined as the shortest distance between saccade start and endpoints, in degrees of visual angle (e.g. McSorley, Haggard, & Walker,2006). 

##### 2. Latency

Latency was defined as the interval between the target onset and the saccade onset, in milliseconds (e.g. McSorley, Haggard, & Walker,2006).

##### 3. Direction

The direction was defined as the angular deviation of saccade direction taken from the initial fixation location to the final endpoint in polar coordinates,(e.g. McSorley, Haggard, & Walker,2006).

##### 4. Curvature 

1. Area Under the Curve (McSorley, Haggard, & Walker, 2006)
    - Once saccades had been identified, the direction and magnitude of curvature were computed by finding the area under the curve formed by the sampled curved saccade trajectory, relative to the direct distance between fixation and landing position (see also Lud- wig & Gilchrist, 2002).
    - **Normalization:** the area measure was divided by the amplitude of the saccade to obtain a ratio measure of curvature per unit amplitude.
    - **Baseline removal:**  since saccade trajectories are never completely straight, the area of curvature observed in no-distractor (baseline) conditions were subtracted from that observed under distractor conditions.
    -  ![area_under_curve](assets/img/notes/cognition/area_under_curve.png)
2. Curvature Ratio (Smit and Van Gisbergen, 1990)
    -   A quantitative measure of the curvature (C) of the spatial saccadic trajectory is determined by the ratio of largest perpendicular deviation P from the straight line connecting onset and offset of the movement to the amplitude (or radius, R).
    -   $C = P / R$
    -   Using this measure, a semi-circle has a curvature of 0.5, whereas a curvature of 0 indicates a perfectly straight line.
    -   When the saccade trajectory made a detour in the clockwise direction from this straight-line path, a negative sign was assigned to C; otherwise, C was positive.
    - ![area_under_curve](assets/img/notes/cognition/curve_ratio.png)
    
##### 5. Deviation v.s. Curvature 
(see Van der Stigchel, Meeter, & Theeuwes, 2006)

1. **curvature** is generally used to describe differences in trajectories from saccadic fixation to the saccade endpoint (i.e. whether the saccade was a straight line or a curved one)
  - Some measures include all sample points on the trajectory of the saccade (Area curvature, Quadratic curvature, and Saccade deviation),
  - Other measures focus on one specific sample (Initial direction, Maximum deviation, and Saccade endpoint). 
2. **deviation** measures mainly compare the saccade trajectory with a straight line from saccadic fixation to the designated target position.
  - some measures use as a reference a straight line to a predefined target (Saccade deviation, Saccade endpoint, Overall initial direction)

##### 6. Relationships between parameters

1. When the instantaneous velocity of the eye during a saccade is plotted as a function of eye position as the eye advances from its starting point to its goal (a phase-plane plot), it becomes apparent that similar size saccades have similar velocity profiles, while the velocity profiles for different size saccades diverge early in the course of the movements
2. When saccades are plotted as peak velocity versus amplitude, in the so-called main sequence analysis, we can find saccades group into clusters and with each cluster there is a linear relationship between the peak velocity and amplitude, regardless of whether saccades are vertical, horizontal, or oblique. Becker, W., & Jürgens, R. (1990).
3. For any saccade, there was a linear relationship between peak and average component velocity. (King, W. M., Lisberger, S. G., & Fuchs, A. F. (1986))

(see Amador, Schlag-Rey, & Schlag, 1998)

This paradigm attracts research attention because patients with frontal lobe lesions  (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al. 1991) or basal ganglia disorders (Lasker et al. 1987; Tian et al. 1991) show severe deterioration in antisaccades performance while some facilitations in prosaccades (i.e., saccades directed to the visual stimulus) performance (Amador, Schlag-Rey, & Schlag, 1998). This anti-saccade task is not an easy one. In monkey research, each novel direction of antisaccade had to be trained anew by successive approximation; there was no evidence of sudden insight in the antisaccade rule (Amador, Schlag-Rey, & Schlag, 1998). 

Successful performance of antisaccades to goals defined by instruction depends on the conjunction of several abilities: 

1. conceptual, understanding the antisaccade instruction; 
2. computational, calculating an inverted retinal error vector; 
3. inhibitory, repressing reflexive orienting;
4. motor, self-initiating a saccade to an unmarked location. 

Three characteristics were consistently reported to distinguish antisaccades from prosaccades in human studies: 

1. decreased accuracy, 
2. longer latency, 
3. slower velocity.
4. lower peak velocity

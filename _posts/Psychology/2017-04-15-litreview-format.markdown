A reference frame defines the set of all possible locations and enables a representation to convey information of locations, but it does not specify what rules and variables are used to describe a location in it. A description of location can take various forms. It can be a proposition of spatial relationship, a label on a map, or a coordinate tuple of ordered numbers. To understand the way our visual system characterize a location is to answer the **format** question of location representation (McCloskey, 2009). 

For the same information, different representational formats will make certain aspects of it explicit at the expense of pushing other aspects into background. The explicit part is readily accessible whereas the part in background may become hard to recover (Marr, 1982). Different formats that provide access to different aspects of information lead to, or require, different solutions to the same computational problem. Certain formats lead to easy and straightforward solutions for a set of problems whereas others require complicated solutions, or have no solutions, for the same set of problems. For example, as illustrated by Marr (1982), numbers can be represented in a Roman-Character system, a Chinese-Character system, a decimal numeral system, or a binary numeral system. To solve whether a number is a factor of 2, these different formats of number representation needs different algorithmic solutions. A solution based on the binary representation of numbers is intuitive and simple: any number with a single 1 and zero or multiple 0s, such as 1000 (in binary format), is a factor of 2. A solution based on the decimal representation is harder: we may recursively test whether a number is 1 or half of its value is a factor of 2. A solution based on the Roman or the Chinese representation is hard to conceive. If exists at all, the solution cannot be as simple as previous ones. Similarly, what format is used to describe a location is closely related to how the visual system solves computations problems that involve location information. Thus, this section surveys three possible representational formats of locations and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these formats in computations.

First, a cognitive system can represent a location with a set of propositions, similar to what we do with our language. These propositions organize symbols, such as spatial words and phrases, with syntax, and convey location information. With symbols and syntactic rules, propositions can represent an object’s location in a given reference frame and its relationships with other objects in the same reference frame. Recent developmental and neuroimaging research have shown evidence that our cognitive system uses such a format to represent location when it attempts to solve visual tasks.

The propositional representation, however, has its limitations. It only makes the spatial relationship explicit, but cannot support quantitative visual computations, such as calculating length. Nor can it easily construct a global description of a space that includes multiple objects, because it mainly describes the local relationships. Moreover, such propositional representation unlikely exists in pre-linguistic children or animals. Considering that adults, children, and animals share many visual abilities, there must be non-propositional representational formats of locations that are shared by all these populations.

A nominal format is a good candidate. A nominal representation uses different labels, or name tags, as symbols to represent locations, as what we do in maps and guidebook lists. Neuroscience has found an example in the brain: place cells in the hippocampus together work as such a nominal representation system. 

The nominal format still has its limitations: it also cannot support quantitative computations in vision. A better choice is a coordinate system that uses tuples of numbers, or coordinates, to represent locations, and provide quantitative information for visual computations. The most intuitive choice is the Cartesian coordinate system because it is widely used in science and engineering to represent locations. A curvilinear coordinate system, however, may more likely be used in the brain because the topological organization in multiple visual areas starts with a logarithmic Polar coordinate system in the primary visual cortex. Similar curvilinear coordinate systems are also found in motor areas and other subcortical nuclei.

All three candidate representational formats have their own characteristics when they represent location information. Next three sections thus survey these three formats respectively.


## The Propositional Representation

We use languages to describe locations. In daily conversations, we rarely talk about a location of an object by saying that this object sits at (3, 0, 1) on the table surface. Instead, we describe the location by saying that this object is ON TOP OF the table. Similarly, we describe that a chair is NEXT TO a desk, the desk is TO THE LEFT OF a lamp, and the lamp is BELOW the ceiling of the room. That is, we use a sequence of propositions to describe locations in the space. This sequence of propositions is constructed by organizing symbols, which indicates spatial relationships (e.g. On TOP OF) or properties of objects (WHITE WALL), in a specific syntactic structure. By using these propositions, we can describe and understand spatial relationships between multiple objects. One advantage of the propositional representation is that it offers a robust and stable description of spatial relationships even if large location perturbations are introduced. For example, an apple that is ON TOP OF a table could change its location in space dramatically, such as from the left corner of the table surface to the right corner of the table surface, but still remains ON TOP OF the table. In this case, the proposition is always true no matter how large a perturbation is applied to the location of this apple, as long as the apple is still attached to the upper surface of the table. This robust propositional representation is useful to maintain a stable understanding of locations and their relationships because the sensory information into our cognitive system is always noisy. This propositional representation can also quickly localize a target region when precise spatial information is not necessary.

Developmental research has provided insightful evidence that suggests the human cognitive system indeed uses a propositional representation for location to solve computational problems, such as searching in space after disorientation (Hermer & Spelke, 1996; Hermer-Vazquez, Spelke & Katsnelson, 1999), or binding features into objects (Dessalegn & Landau, 2008; Landau & Lakusta, 2009).

In the space-searching task, a participant enters a novel environment, such as a rectangular room, and watches an experimenter hiding an object in one corner of the room. He is then disoriented, such as turning for 10 rotations with eyes closed. Later, he opens eyes and tries to find the location of the hidden object (Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Both children and adults, when participating in this task, search at either the correct corner or at its rotationally equivalent corner. If one wall is painted in blue, however, adults then only search at the correct corner. That adults use a different search strategy when one wall is blue suggests that they use spatial information that is not simply geometry. In contrast, children at the age of 20-month or so still frequently search at the geometrically equivalent corner regardless of the blue wall (Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Interestingly, if adults undertook a verbal interference task during the space-searching task, they performed similarly to the children. That is, they mistakenly searched at the geometrically equivalent corners as frequently as at the correct corner even the blue wall is present as a cue (Hermer-Vazquez, Spelke, & Kastnelson, 1999). These results suggest that adults use linguistic information, such as NEXT TO THE BLUE WALL, to describe a location in order to help their reorientation. 

Propositional location information also helps children to maintain a stable understanding of feature conjunctions (Dessalegn and Landau, 2008). For example, 4-year-old children are asked to remember a briefly presented bi-color target, and to match it with another three bi-color options a moment later. These bi-color stimuli have particular spatial arrangement of two colors: the target may be a square whose left half was green and right half was red; the probes may be the same as the target, or a mirror-reflection of the target whose right half was green and left half was red, or a control square that is split into two triangles with lower triangle being green and upper triangle being red. By simply watching, children match the target with the correct sample only in 60% trials, and make most errors by choosing the mirror-reflection option. In contrast, with the help of an instruction “The red is to the left of the green”, children can improve their performance above 80% accuracy. A similar sentence “the red is touching the green”, however, cannot help children’s performance. Therefore, the directional label [TO THE LEFT OF] in the proposition is the key to helping children to process location information.

Landau and Lakusta (2009) suggested that human uses a propositional format for representing a location, and such propositional representation helps other non-linguistic representations in solving visual tasks. Children, as shown in previous examples, gradually learn the propositional representation during their development.

Brain research also suggests that a propositional representation of location is used when the brain processes spatial information. Recent working memory studies has shown that our brain represents a relationship between locations of two objects in a different way it represents the absolute locations of these two objects. Observers are asked to remember the spatial information of two targets, either their relative spatial relationship or their absolute location on the screen. After seconds of delay, observers need to judge whether two new probe dots have the same relative spatial relationships as the targets, or whether a new probe dot is at the same location as one of the two targets. Observers have higher accuracy and shorter reaction time when matching the spatial relationships than matching the absolute locations. Neuroimaging results showed that the maintenance of the relationships, not absolute locations, activates the frontal cortex and suppresses early sensory areas (Ikkai, Blacker, Lakshmanan, Ewen, Courtney, 2014). These results hint at a neural correlate that underlies a propositional representation of location in the frontal cortex.

The propositional representation, however, has its limitations: it does not provide accessible information for many computations. For example, this representation cannot support distance calculation. The proposition of "an apple is TO THE LEFT OF an orange" does not indicate how far these two objects are away from each other. Another drawback of the propositional representation is that it could lose information of relationships when the transitive property fails. For example, an apple is TO THE LEFT OF an orange, and a pineapple is TO THE RIGHT OF the apple. For these two propositions, we cannot know for sure the relative positions between the orange and the pineapple. Due to these limitations, the propositional representation might not be used in the visual system. Rather, it may belong to other independent modules, which is parallel with the visual system. 

## The Nominal Representations

The propositional representation may only exist in human, because it is related to the ability to use languages. Despite not being able to use language, animals share many visual abilities with the human and solve many vision problems as human does. Therefore, animals and human must share some non-propositional formats when their cognitive systems try to represent location information.

A candidate format can use labels, or names, to denote different locations. This format is called a nominal representational format (McCloskey, 2009). When a new location needs a representation, we create a new symbol to name this location. For example, we use New York City to represent the area of a city that locates at the southern tip of the state of New York. By labeling different locations, we can easily differentiate whether the current location is the same as a previous location. We can also make an ordered list of labels, such as (Penn, Aberdeen, Bowie State, BWI airport) to construct a path or a trajectory of motion. For example, by using Google map, we can set an ordered list of labels of cities to describe the destinations in our last road trip. In short, the nominal representation can clearly discriminate different locations and provide a concise guide for the navigation or path integration. 

Neuroscience research of hippocampus system has found a place cell system that adopts such a nominal format in spatial representation. When a rat is freely moving in a bounded area, some pyramidal neurons in the dorsal portion of its hippocampus, called CA1, become active when the rat enters a particular place in that bounded world. This place is called the place field of the activated neuron, and the neuron, because it is sensitive to a specific place, is called a place cell (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971). Each place cell behaves like a label that refers to an area in the outside environment. If a label is used – namely, a neuron is activated – the rat’s brain represents the location where the rat stays in the environment at that moment. The activities of a population of place cells thus create a neural map that representing the current outside environment (O'Keefe, 1976; O'Keefe and Conway, 1978). Such a neural map is suggested to be a neural correlate of the cognitive map (Tolman, 1948), based on which rats can navigate the environment.

Unlike the retinotopic map in the visual system, in the place cell system, neighboring place cells are as likely to have nearby fields as distant ones (O'Keefe, Burgess, Donnett, Jeffery, & Maguire, 1998). As the rat travels through the environment, different place cells fire successively, representing a trajectory of motion. Together with heading cells and velocity cells, which are responsive to specific heading directions and motion velocity respectively, the place cell system is suggested to perform a path-integration computation to help navigation (Knierim, Kudrimoti, McNaughton, 1996). A recent experiment used a deformable U-shaped maze to show that place cells form a subway-map-like spatial representation that only cares about the order to the locations, but not the geometry between two locations (Dabaghian, Brandt, & Frank, 2014). Dabaghian and colleagues (2014) constructed a multi-arm track with joints that connect successive arms. These joints can flexibly arrange the arms in different geometrical structures by changing the angle between two arms. The change of geometry, however, does not change the topology of the track – the relative order of joints from the starting point to the ending point remains the same. When rats ran through different geometrical arrangements of the track, the same place cells fired at the same part on the track, regardless of its geometry. That is, directions of arms on the track, turning angles at the joints, and the overall geometrical shape of the environment does not play roles in how place cells represent a location on the traveling path. The place cell system is similar to a subway-map, which only describes the different successive stations and abstracts the physical geometry information of the route between the two stations.

One problem of the nominal representation concerns the number of different symbols that are used in this system. To discriminate different locations, the nominal representation needs to create a new symbol in order to represent a new location. How can such representation describe all possible, essentially infinite many, locations in a reference frame? Thus, the nominal representation must only be able to represent a local environment of limited space. It may also reuse old symbols in new environments. O'Keefe and his colleagues (2002) suggests that the hippocampus system could update its map and remap a new area—many place cells can simultaneously rearrange their place fields in different environments. When a rat enters a new environment, its place cell system learns a new rearrangement of place fields for neurons and such new representation remains stable in the environment (Lever, Wills, Cacucci, Burgess, & O'Keefe, 2002). However, such finding only shows that the same neuron could represent two different locations in two environments, but does not provide direct evidence of reusing symbols in nominal representations – because it is unclear what symbols are used. If a neuron is a symbol of the nominal representation, and if the hippocampus system can recycle the symbols to denote new locations, a computational process is needed. The computational process needs to clarify how old symbols are recycled and are assigned with new meaning. Furthermore, for a place cell to have a new place field in a new environment, it must receive inputs from other sources that provide a more detailed description of the locations in the environment. That is, another location representation is needed to provide inputs to the place cell system. Mosers and their colleagues (2005) have found cells in medial entorhinal cortex project onto cells in CA1. Particularly, they have found a type of cells, later termed as the grid cells, fires in multiple places and collectively form nodes of an extended hexagonal grid (Hafting, Fyhn, Molden, Moser, & Moser, 2005). This grid-cell system seems to serve as a coordinate system that can provide inputs to the place-cell system in the hippocampus.

Does visual system use a nominal representation? McCloskey (2009) suggested that it is unlikely that the visual system uses such a representational format. As mentioned above, a nominal representation can hardly provide a description of too many locations and it ignores geometry. It can neither represent locations in fine details, nor can it provide a compositional description of locations in a multi-dimensional space. Accordingly, the nominal representation does not have information for geometrical transformations, such as reflection, rotation, or scaling, and it also cannot support computations of velocity or object recognition by components (Bierderman, 1987; Marr & Nishihara 1978). 

Computations in both the hippocampus place cell system and the visual system hints that a compositional, quantitative representation is used to represent location information. A coordinate system may be a candidate.

## The Coordinate Representations

A coordinate system uses an ordered array of numbers, called coordinates, to describe a location in a reference frame. It is a compositional and quantitative representation format that can easily describe locations in any multi-dimensional space. For example, a two-dimensional coordinate system may describe a location in the form of (x, y) that represents this location’s signed (positive or negative) horizontal displacement and signed vertical displacement from the origin point of the reference frame. This specific coordinate system is called the Cartesian coordinate system. Coordinate systems link geometry to algebra, and provide analytical solutions to geometry problems. To understand a location and perform computations that involve location information, the coordinate system has multiple advantages compared with the previous representation format.

First of all, a coordinate representation, with its compositional nature, decomposes location information into values of multiple components or variables. Each component is independent of the rest, and represents one aspect of a location. This compositional representation requires much fewer symbols in representing a multi-dimensional location. For example, to represent locations in an N-by-N grid system on a 2D plane, a nominal representation need to use N2 symbols to distinctively represent each one location in this grid system, but a coordinate system, such as the Cartesian coordinate system, only needs 2N symbols, with each symbol uniquely stands for x = 1, x = 2 … x = n, y = 1, y = 2, …. y = n. As the number of dimensionality or the scale within one dimension increases, the number of symbols in a nominal representation may increase exponentially whereas the number of symbols in a coordinate system only increases linearly. Thus, the coordinate system can represent a much large scale of space without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. 

Second, a coordinate system provides metrics with which one can measure magnitudes such as length and size. Each component of a coordinate system has a zero value and a unit magnitude, and it can afford algebraic computations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Thus, the coordinate system can provide a quantitative description of a location, in contrast to qualitative descriptions from propositional and nominal representations. Those basic algebraic computations support more complex computations, such as calculating the distance between two locations, translating or rotating a point from one location to another, scaling or shearing aspects of a shape in the space. Considering all complicated geometric transformations in the visual system that involves locations, only a coordinate system can make all required quantities available for each calculation.

### Cartesian Coordinate System

The Cartesian coordinate system has straight, perpendicular axes that partition the space in rectangular grids. Each coordinate represents a signed distance on one axis between the distant location and the origin point. Each rectangular grid has the same area regardless of where the origin point is located. Thus the Cartesian coordinate systems do not heavily rely on the origin point. Translations and reflections are simple in the Cartesian coordinate system. The former one is only a linear calculation and the latter is only a sign change in coordinates. Additionally, the mathematical tools are usually developed in the Cartesian coordinate system. Therefore, the Cartesian coordinate system is a natural and intuitive choice when researchers study the location representations.

![Figure 6](/assets/img/thesis-figure/figure6.png)  
Figure 6: the Cartesian coordinate system and the polar coordinate system

Artificial visual systems, such as computer vision systems, mainly use the Cartesian coordinate system. This is a reasonable engineering choice because most inputs are in rectangle formats, such as images, photos, or papers. These inputs usually have information organized in row-by-column matrices. Computations, such as edge detection, blurring and sharpening, optic-flow motion analysis, are usually calculated with respect to row information (x-axis) or column information (y-axis). Another example is that such system uses a rectangular bounding box to represents the location of a recognized object, which is essentially in a Cartesian coordinate system.

When it comes to the human cognitive system, Gallistel (1990) has argued that the navigation system in hippocampus should follow a Cartesian coordinate system because such coordinate system is more stable when the navigation system accumulates small distances in a path. Because the Cartesian coordinate system partitions the whole space in equal-size rectangular grids regardless of where the origin is located, integrating a path only needs to add successive grid units to compute the overall length. In path integration, the integration system needs to constantly estimate the current distance to the origin and calculate the size of grid units, and provide a feedback to the system in updating the new distance for calculating next grid unit. With each grid unit being equal, the Cartesian coordinate system can avoid accumulative errors that are carried over to future computations. Thus the Cartesian coordinate system in navigation is a good design choice, which is more likely to be adopted by the nature in designing the biological system (Gallistel & Matzel, 2013; Klatzky, 1998). 

In addition to the navigation system, the saccade system also seems to operate in a Cartesian coordinate system. Physiological and behavioral evidence has shown that the saccade system has independent horizontal and vertical components (Bahill and Stark, 1977). Electrophysiological studies have identified separate neural channels with different motor control centers, different motor neurons, and different eye muscles that implement the horizontal and vertical components of a saccade respectively (Bahill and Stark, 1975, 1979). Behavioral studies have shown that oblique saccades are rarely straight because the horizontal and the vertical component usually don't have the same starting time or ending time. In fact, it is even possible that one component starts after the other component has finished. Among thousands of saccades examined by Bahill and Stark (1975), Only 40% oblique saccades have synchronized starting and ending time for both components. For 15% of oblique saccades, their vertical and horizontal components did not start or end at the same time, of which 12% had temporal overlap, and 3% had no temporal overlap. For the rest 45% oblique saccades, vertical and horizontal components only either started at the same time or ended at the same time (Bahill and Stark, 1975). 

### The Curvilinear Coordinate System

The Curvilinear Coordinate system actually is an umbrella term that includes a polar coordinate system of 2D planes, and spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems of 3D space. All of these specify a distant location to the origin point in terms of distances and angles. In result, a curvilinear coordinate system can easily represent rotations and curves, such as circles and spirals. It also places more emphasis on the origin point than the Cartesian coordinate system does, but concern less about relative shifts in horizontal or vertical directions. The range of the distance value is always calculated from a distant object to the origin, with a range from zero to infinity. Such emphasis can lead to computational convenience for cases where objects rotate around the same point with the same distance. Human body parts are such cases. Each part between two joints has a constant length and rotates around a fixed joint, and the ending point only moves on a spherical surface. Because distance is fixed in these cases, a curvilinear coordinate system can only use two variables to describe the possible locations of a body part in the space: the angular rotation away from the horizontal and vertical plane. In contrast, a Cartesian coordinate system has to use three variables. 

Abundant neuroscience evidence suggests that the brain system uses curvilinear coordinate representations to process sensory and motor information. 

Visual cortices, at least the primary visual cortex (V1), may use a log-polar coordinate system to represent locations in the visual field. Holmes (1944), who has established the organization of the V1 with the evidence from injured veterans, has found that neurons in the occipital pole represent information on the retina’s fovea, and the information in the occipital lobe is organized in a polar coordinate map: information on same ventral-dorsal axis corresponds to information from the upper visual field to lower visual field in the same distance to the fovea; information on the same posterior-anterior axis represents information from fovea to peripheral areas in the visual field at the same angle away from horizontal meridian. 

Additionally, cortical representation of fovea occupies a larger area in V1 than a cortical representation of peripheral visual fields do. This disproportional transformation is termed as cortical magnification, which is quantified by the cortical magnification factor (CMF) and measured as how many millimeters in cortex correspond to per degree in the visual field. Based on data from electrical stimulations of a human patient, Coway and Rolls (1974) has computed that the CMF is approximately 4mm/degree at 2 degrees eccentricity and 0.5mm/degree at 25 degrees eccentricity. Such inhomogeneity in spatial representation cannot be described by a simple Cartesian coordinate system. In fact, Schwartz (1980a) has shown that the above-mentioned organization in V1 is best characterized by a log-polar coordinate system.

This log-polar neural mapping of information in the visual field is found in primary visual cortices in different species, such as cat, monkey, and human, with only differences in values of parameters (Schwartz, 1980a, 1980b, 1983). In human behavioral research, studies of geometrical visual hallucinations provide indirectly, but converging evidence: visual hallucinations from using LSD and cannabis usually generate forms of radiations, spirals, honeycombs, or concentric circles. Mathematical modeling and simulations showed that a log-polar coordinate system in V1 provides the best explanation of such a phenomena (Ermentrout & Cowan, 1979; Bressloff, Cowan, Golubitsky, Thomas, Wiener, 2001). 

It is not clear whether such a log-polar topological mapping of information in space still exists in visual areas beyond V1, although recent evidence suggests some coarser versions do exist. In the dorsal pathway, retinotopic maps in as far as parietal cortices can be segmented by angular rotation or at least by the contralateral correspondence. Whether information of the same eccentricity from the fovea is structurally organized in these areas is rarely clear and often dismissed in investigations (Silver & Kastner, 2009). In the ventral pathway, understanding of organizational structures of cortices emphasized the computations of processing specific visual identity information over the location information, and usually left the location information undefined. Among a few, Levy and colleagues (2001) have shown that different ventral cortices have different biases in processing information fovea and peripheral visual. For example, the Fusiform Face Area is more sensitive to fovea information whereas the Parahippocampal Place Areas is more sensitive to peripheral information. This difference in processing spatial information suggests a central-peripheral organization in ventral pathway.

Figure 7: Log-Polar Coordinate System in the Primary Visual Cortex (Schwartz, 1983)

In addition to the visual cortices, other brain sensory and motor areas also seem to use curvilinear coordinate systems. To represent a sound location, the auditory system uses a sphere coordinate system centered on the head, and represents each location in terms of the distance away from the center, the angular rotation away from the vertical meridian plane (the azimuth), and the angular rotation away from the horizontal plane (the elevation) (Knudsen & Konishi, 1978; Yantis, 2013). Neurons in premotor areas and motor areas also have preferred directions and distances in planning and executing motor signals, rather than preferred displacements in x-, y-, z- axes in a Cartesian coordinate system (Caminiti, Johnson, Galli, Ferraina, & Y. Burnod, 1991). Similar spherical coordinate systems are found in visuomotor areas in parietal cortices (Lacquaniti, Guigon, Bianchi, Ferraina, & Caminiti, 1995). More importantly, brain areas that process multi-sensory information and coordinate sensory and motor information are shown to represent locations in the curvilinear coordinate system. For example, superior colliculus (SC) has visual and auditory layers that use aligned curvilinear coordinate systems in each layer. With such a structural alignment, SC receives and integrates both auditory and visual location information and computes the next salient point for planning motor responses, such as saccades (Goldberg & Wurtz, 1972; Knudsen, 1982; Knudsen & Brainard, 1995; Wurtz & Goldberg, 1972). 

This prevalence of curvilinear coordinate systems in sensory and motor brain areas may be closely related to the choice of an egocentric reference frame. Each egocentric reference frame provides a clearly defined origin. From the origin, our body can only stretch out to a limited distance, but can flexibly rotate in different directions. A 3D spherical coordinate representation can readily characterize the accessible space by our body in the egocentric reference frame. Different sensory and motor signals can also accurately coordinate information by using the same curvilinear coordinate system. Even if some information is mainly two-dimensional (like visual information) and other is mainly three-dimensional (like auditory information), transformations between two curvilinear systems are more accurate than those between a Cartesian system and a curvilinear system. This is because projecting a three-dimensional curvilinear coordinate system onto a two-dimensional Cartesian system is error-prone, and can only be approximately accurate. Such computational difficulties can be best exemplified by the Geological Information System design: when representing the surface of the Earth, a 2D-map rarely uses a Cartesian coordinate system. The GIS uses a longitude-latitude system or a polar coordinate system to present the surface of the Earth in different viewpoints.    

Although the topological organization of neurons in brain implies that information in the world is mapped onto neuron activities by a log-polar mapping function, it is unclear whether the visual system really represents location information by using variables like the eccentricity and the angle. It is also unclear what computational consequence will be by using a log-polar coordinate system instead of a Cartesian coordinate system. This question leads to my thesis research.

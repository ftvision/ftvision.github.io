## Feitong Yang - Resume of Failures
{: page-header}

> Successes are only rare spikes among background noises of failures in daily life. 
<br> Achieving more successes comes from failing faster, failing more often, then learning more and keeping on. 

Here is a running list of my failures during my journey. I was trying to summarize all of them, but some have eluded my memory. I will keep maintaining this list, so future failures will be recorded and updated. You are welcome to come back and check my latest failures.

#DefaultDict
#The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections
#class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, 
#but it has one difference: The value fields' data type is specified upon 
#initialization. 
from collections import defaultdict

d['python'].append("awesome")
d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
d['python'].append("language")

    print i
#('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
#('something-else', ['not relevant'])

#An OrderedDict is a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys that were inserted first. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged.
#Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types. 
#They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks. 
#With `namedtuples`, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.
#The `defaultdict` tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but it has one difference: The value fields' data type is specified upon initialization.

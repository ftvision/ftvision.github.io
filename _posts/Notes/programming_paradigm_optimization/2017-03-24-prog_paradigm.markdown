## Programming Paradigms

A programming paradigm is an approach to programming a computer based on a mathematical theory or a coherent set of principles. Each paradigm supports a set of concepts that makes it the best for a certain kind of problem.

You won't be able to learn all the programming languages in the wrold, but you can learn the shared philosophy and concepts for many programming languages. By learning programming paradigm, we learn the essence of those shared parts, and extrapolate our knowledge when detailed implementation of one language is encountered.

## Programming Optimization

In computer science, program optimization or software optimization is the process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources. In general, a computer program may be optimized so that it executes more rapidly, or is capable of operating with less memory storage or other resources, or draw less power.

### Data-oriented design

I came to know the *data-oriented design* or *data-oriented programming* when I was an intern programmer at a game studio, [the Sparkypants studio](https://www.sparkypants.com/).

I started to systematically learn the deep neural network architectures when I decided to take [the Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree course at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/degrees/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101). It is a really introductory but comprehensive course that provide lots of materials.

The notes here are based on the course contents, but aim to extend beyond the course contents by taking other references.

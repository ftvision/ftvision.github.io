## Introduction

To understand a programming language in depth, or to master a programming language, is not trivial. It definitely takes lots of time and practices. In this set of notes, I will gradually collect materials during my learning of several languages.

To goal is to write reliable, fast, protable, short, elegant, and readable code.

## Language points

## Pacakges and libraries

## Styles

Once we have managed programming basics, we can start to learn styles for each programming languages. These styles can help us to write readable and reliable codes.

## A collection of helpful entries

There are many great discussions and explanations on specific knowledge points online. Online communities, such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), are really helpful during my learning. I think it is important to learn, and then summarize a list of helpful entries online for quick references in the future.

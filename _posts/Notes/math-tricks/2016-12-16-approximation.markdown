## Introduction 

There are many approximations tricks in mathematics. Some of these approximations simplify computations, others bridge different theories. 

### Approximation of Numbers

- when $x$ is small, usually $x \ll 1$ 

$$\log(1 + x) = x$$

<blockquote class="proof">
Proof: $x \ll 1$ 

$$\frac{d\log(1+x)}{dx} = \frac{1}{(1 + x)}$$

</blockquote>

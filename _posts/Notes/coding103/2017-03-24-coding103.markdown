## Introduction

I am really far away from the advanced level of programing, even though I started programming since 2003. In fact, advanced programmers are not easy to find despite the large population of software engineers nowadays. So I won't have any "real" notes here for a long time. 

Instead, I have collected some interesting conversations or opinions here. They are NOT advanced programming notes, but they are fun. Contents here may be moved to other places in the future. For example, they may be integrated into parts of intermediate programming notes.

## Language Standards 

As an advanced programmer, one is supposed to have a network of solid and fundamental knowledge of programming. Here is a list of international standards for different languages. None of these standards serve a pedagogical role. All of them are long and tedious. They are, however, all agreed foundations for each language. So they may be good references.

- [C Standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/) and [C11 Documents](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf)
- [C++ Standard](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard)

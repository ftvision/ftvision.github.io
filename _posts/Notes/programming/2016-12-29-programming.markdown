## Introduction

Programming, in its simplest form, is to ask the computer to do things. The computer is both the smartest and dumbest machine at the same time. It is smart, because it can do incredibly complicated tasks and can even beat human in some cognitive tasks. It is dumb, because it can only do what it is asked to do.

>learning coding and mastering coding are completely two different things. The former is always enjoyable, the latter takes strenuous efforts.

#### Learning Coding is **Easy**

Programming is **easy**. It only concerns several basic core operations and logics. To receive, store, manipulate, and output the data, to control the flow of procedures, to loop the same procedure again and again, to jump between different procedures. Therefore, learning to code should not be a daunting task. It should be natural, playful, and enjoyable. Moreover, different programming languages, despite their different philosophies and motivations, all carry the same basic core operations. When one manages one language, it could be easy for him/her to translate to another language to do basic tasks and operations.

You should start to enjoy coding.

#### Mastering Coding is **Hard**

Programming is also **hard**. There are countless ways of organizing and integrating the basic operations. Different logics, with the help of algorithms and data structures,

#### The languages that are concerned here

I started my programming experience with `pascal`. When I say `pascal`, I probably sound ancient, since many may have not heard of it at all. It's a good tutorial programming language and it can get things done. I have used `pascal` for competitive programming in my whole middle-school and high-school life, but to be honest, I barely remember it anymore, although I can still read it. It's sad that I never see that any more. 

Translating from `pascal`, `C/C++` languages are probably the closet family to me. However, `C/C++` turned out to be a monster. To be fair, `C` is quite compact and I enjoyed learning it. It has limited bascis and the rest all depend on your creativity. When I joined to develop a game engine, I found `C` is amicable. `C++` is definitely a monster. It can be thought as four different languages (Meyer, 2005), each of which has its own philosophy in programming.

Several scripting languages are quite powerful now, especially in scientific computing, data mining, machine learning, and even general contexts. All of these languages have extended their original goal to a broader scope. `matlab`, `R`, and `python` are concerned here. 

When we move to the online community, `javascript` becomes the dominant one. `Javascript` was never made to do tasks that it is doing right now, but the history selected it, and currently there is no alternative choices. Of course, there are variations of `javascripts`, some of which has evolved into a quite _language-y_ state. 

As a cognitive psychologies, who wanted to learn more about Turing and Churchs's idea of computability, a functional programming languages `Haskell` is also concerned here. I heard that it is totally different from others, but I have not tried it yet.

Lastly, `shell`, or more specifically, `bash`, also has its position here. 

Mark-up languages, such as `HTML` or `Markdown`, are not concerned here. Nor is the `CSS`. They don't bear the same logic, in my opinion, as other languages here.

Type and Value

>A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. The values we have seen so far are 1, 2, and 'Hello, World!'.
>These values belong to different types: 2 is an integer, and 'Hello, World!' is a string, so-called because it contains a “string” of letters.

>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value.An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values


Variable names. Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they have to begin with a letter. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you’ll see why later). The underscore character, _, can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as my_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow

Avoid `keyword`

> Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values the operator is applied to are called operands.

> The operators +, -, *, / and ** perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation, as in the following examples:


An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions

A **statement** is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statement: print and assignment.

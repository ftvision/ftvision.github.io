A Unix/Linux system has a large set of system utilities -- commands that have a wide range of functions. In the system, we don't have Graphic Interfaces to interact with, nor can we click on a mouse to activate softwares or to instruct the system to do things. Commands are *the tools* with which we can ask a computer to work.

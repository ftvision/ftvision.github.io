The file system in Unix/Linux is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree. The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called `root` (written as a slash `/` )

The file system follows the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)](http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml). This [UNIX FileSystem Wiki entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) serves as a good summary of the file system.

A path of a file in a Unix/Linus system looks like:

```
/home/its/ug1/ee51vn/report.doc 
```

There are so many references online and in store. Cross-reference can help, as I discovered, to understand difficult concepts; but it can also cost a lot of time if you want to go over several tutorials, as I did. The reason I went through multiple tutorials is because I fear I may miss some important or clever parts of a language. I guess there should be a smarter way to do that. 

Here are some references that I use for my notes.

## Scratch the surface

If you only want to scratch the surface of learning some programming language, there are fast ways to do that. If you want to be more serious and learn a language in depth, go to the section of that language below.

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) provides interactive tutorials for many languages. Many of them are related to web design. This set of tutorials are very basic, but it gives you a taste of each language. Good for someone who wants to play and learn with nothing too serious.
- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) provides several good, interactive tutorials for `C++`, `Python`, `Shell`, `Java`, `Ruby`, and some `functional programming language`. In fact, these tutorials are quite decent in terms of difficulties; they provide introductions to several intermediate-level knowledge for each language. Good for someone who are more serious about learning bascis of a programming language.
- [Learn Code the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/) by Zed Shaw covers several languages. It started with `Python`, but has evolved into a series of tutorials that covers `C`, `Ruby`, `SQL`, `Javascript`, and so on. This series serves as a crash course for me whenever I want to pick up a new language. I like the way Zed Shaw presents different aspects of a language and the idea of learning by coding. Some parts of this series is still in beta version. 
- [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/) provides lots of information for learning a language. Some materials are basic, others may be more difficult. It organizes different contents by chapters; each chapter is not too long to read. The tutorials point covers a wide range of tutorials. If you just google tutorials of a progrmaming language, sooner or later you will arrive here. 

## C
 
1. [The C Programming Language 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131103628/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) by Kernighan and Ritchie. **This is the classical K&R book for C**. It is clear and concise, and I really enjoyed reading it. This book, however, seems not be to a good introductory C book for someone who has no background in programming. 
1. [C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition)](http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html) by King. I have quickly skimmed this book. It is a comprehensive one for the beginners, maybe even for those who just start to learn how to program. It has lots of details, but I didn't take too many notes. If you are good with K&R, this probably serves as a reference book or helps you to update your C to C89/C99 standard.
1. [Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131774298/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) by Linden. This one is on my wish list, so I didn't get it yet, but I heard it is a really good book.
1. You can refer to [this stack overflow entry](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/562303/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list) for references. Apparently, I did not and will not read all of them.

## C++

1. I started my C++ journey with [C++ Primer](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113). It is not an easy one, but it is always recommended. This book, however, is easily confused with *C++ Primer Plus*, which is much less favored by the community.
1. [Accelerated C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/020170353X/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) and [A Tour of C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F8CWGOS/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) are short ones that are often compared with K&R's C book. They assume that readers have some experiences in programming, so they talk about C++ in a more consice way.
1. [Effective C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321334876/?tag=stackoverfl08-20), [Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491903996/?tag=stackoverfl08-20), [Effective STL](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201749629/?tag=stackoverfl08-20), and [More Effective C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/020163371X/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) by Scott Meyers are so famous that I don't need to talk too much. This series of books talk about some best practices in C++, and summarize these practices in several rules. From my experience, *Effective C++* and *More Effective C++* are not so easy to get nowadays. 
1. You can refer to [this stack overflow entry](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list) for references. Apparently, again, I did not and will not read all of them.
1. To-be update

## Python

1. [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/)
1. [Effective Python](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493572510&sr=8-1&keywords=effective+python) and [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=fluent+python) are recommended for intermediate and advanced learning of Python.

## Javascript

1. [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) is a good start. 
1. As a Chinese reader, I really appreciate Yifeng Ruan's book. Both [JavaScript Standards Reference Guide](http://javascript.ruanyifeng.com/) and [ECMAScript 6 入门](http://es6.ruanyifeng.com/) are good books to read. 

## R

1. Eric Nord's [Essential R](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat484/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.stat484/files/EssentialR.pdf) is a good, short introduction of R.  
1. Winston Chang's [cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) has good materials to start R. It has clear demostrations and lots of original code that are useful. I frequently go back to it for the reference of plotting.
1. Paul Teetor's [R Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-OReilly-Cookbooks-Paul-Teetor/dp/0596809158) is an excellent and comprehensive introductory book to start R. 
1. Daniel Wollschlaeger's [R Examples Repository](http://www.uni-kiel.de/psychologie/rexrepos/index.html) has a good collection of advanced topics in R. It covers a wide range of statistical analysis, and detailed explanation of several concepts in statistics!

## Matlab

I actually learned Matlab during my 2011 summer school at UPenn. Instructors there have provided a good Matlab tutorial for students who study computational and cognitive neuroscience. Later, I mainly googled all the parts that I need and did not really systematically learn about matlab from a tutorial. In a [quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-to-learn-about-MATLAB) thread, people also mention that they just practice a lot.

1. [Matlab Primer](http://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2014b/pdf_doc/matlab/getstart.pdf)by Mathworks is a good start provided by the company that made this language.
1. [Matlab tutorial at Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/) seems to be a good place for the basics.
1. [This Another Tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/matlab/) may also be helpful.

## Shell(Bash)

Is shell a programming language? I believe people would say yes, but many shell tutorials look like tutorials that teach how to use Unix/Linux utilities. I don't really like those tutorials.

1. [The Advanced Bash Scripts from Linux Documentation Project Guides](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html)
1. [Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://www.shellscript.sh/) by Steve Parker
1. [Shell Script Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/OpenSource/Conceptual/ShellScripting/shell_scripts/shell_scripts.html) from Apple 
1. [Bash Shell Scripting](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting) by Wikibook.
1. [BASH Programming - Introduction HOW-TO](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html) by Mike G.
1. [GNU Bash Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/)
1. [Learning the Shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php)

## Thesaurus 

There are already several thesaurus documents comparing different languages. The documents that I know are usually **cheatsheet**, and they usually focus on data analysis, rather than general programming. Here is a list of them.

1. Matlab v.s. R: [cheatsheet](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/octave-r.html)

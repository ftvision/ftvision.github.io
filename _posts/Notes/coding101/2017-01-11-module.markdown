Write a module / library

For python:
Any file that contains Python code can be imported as a module.


The only problem with this example is that when you import the module it executes the test code at the bottom. Normally when you import a module, it defines new functions but it doesnâ€™t execute them.

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print linecount('wc.py')
```

```__name__``` is a built-in variable that is set when the program starts. If the program is running as a script, ```__name__``` has the value ```__main__```; in that case, the test code is executed. Otherwise, if the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.

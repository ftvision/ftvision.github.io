When I first think about summarizing my notes for programing, I feel I should summarize multiple languages together -- to make a thesaurus. With this thesaurus, I can compare and contrast different languages, and undertand how they share many common features but vary in details. The basic components of a programming language is simple: data types, control flows, loops, functions, and etc. But when a modern language develops, it usually evolves to be a monster, and *new bases* for this language becomes not basic at all.

I started my programming experience with `Pascal`. When I say `Pascal`, I probably sound ancient. Many people, nowadays, may have not heard of it at all. It's a good tutorial programming language and it can get things done. I have used `Pascal` for competitive programming in my whole middle-school and high-school life, and learned lots of algorithms and data structures with it. Honestly, I barely remember it anymore. I may quickly get it back, but no one really uses it or teaches it any more. So, I am not going to talk about `Pascal` here in this note. I only mention it here because it reminds me of my early programming experiences.

I intend to cover `C/C++`, `Python`, `Javascript`, `R`, `Matlab`, and `Shell` (In fact, `Bash`) here because they are related to my daily life. I probably cannot cover every language in details, because I do not use all of them in every task I have. 

## C/C++

`C` is beautiful and concise. When I finally pick up `C`, and read the K&R book, I feel this is a language that I can manage and enjoy. In that summer, I went to a game studio and joined their game engine development, during which I mainly used `C`, although all files have `.cpp` as their suffix. `C`, however, is not easy, especially its **pointers**. 

`C++` started with an addition to `C` -- an object-oriented C, and has evolved into a monster. I don't really know how people can gain `C++` expertise because this task seems too hard. Scott Meyers said we should treat `C++` to be four different languauges, and we have to separately manage them one by one. I feel it should be named as `C**` rather than `C++`.By the way, it is hilarious to read this [anecdote of Bjarne Stroustrup's Interview](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/I_did_it_for_you_all). The only thing about `C++` I can say is: keep calm, carry on, and hope our life is long. 

## Python

First of all, try to move to `Python 3`. There is no big difference between `Python 2` and `Python 3`, although some subtle changes can be really frustrating. Now we have `__future__` module already, and we have environment managers like `conda`, I hope this may motivate people to move to `Python 3`, even though they still have work that can only be done in `Python 2`.

`Python`'s style is concise and pithy, as long as you can really write a *pythonic* program. It now becomes a main language in data science field, competing with `R`. When I use `Python`, I mainly use it for data related process. Latest algorithms in machine learing and deep neural networks are usually implemented in `Python`, that is probably the reason why it becomes popular.

## Javascript

I still remember those little toolboxes that contain snippets of `Javascript` for some "hack features" in 1990s. I would not imagine `Javascripts` to grow as such an important language nowadays -- even though it still looks awkward to program and debug. As the only programming language that is widely supported by all web browsers, `Javascript` dominates the web; and web dominates our life right now.  

`Javascript` is not well-made to begin with. People now try to talk about its **good parts**. It is surprising that no other language has come to replace `Javascript`, but instead `Javascript` is trying to "replace" many other languages. Where there is a software, there may be a `Javascript` version of it.

## R

I started to learn `R` from the Johns Hopkins Data Science Courses on Coursera. Soon, I have realized its power to do statistical analysis. After all, it was made for statistics. 

I like `R` because it has lots of good pacakges and good data structures to manipulate data. The ploting package `ggplot` in `R` definitely made `R` irreplacable in my daily work. It is a great tool to analyze and visualze data.

But `R` is slow, and not really a general-purpose programming language. I started to shift my focus to `python` recently, because `python` has catch up with `R` in terms of data analysis and visualization and it can do other general work.

## Matlab

Similar to `R`, I used `Matlab` mainly for two things: data analysis and experiment presentation. Nowadays I actually mainly use it for experiment presentation because of the *Psychophysical Toolbox*. It's signal processing and image processing toolbox are precious because they provide several important and cutting-edge functions for solve difficult data processing problems. But I feel it did not really catch up with recent developments in machine learning and deep learning.

## Shell 

I mainly care about `Bash` here. Honestly, I don't feel very comfortable by using `Shell`. I know it is an essential part for Unix/Linux, but I feel other languages, like `Perl` or `Python`, can serve a better role in most cases. Codes in `Python` are much clearer and more readable. Maybe I am not Native to Unix/Linux yet.  

## Haskell

This is one language in my wish list. I want to learn a functional programming language mainly because it seems to provide a totally new perspective towards programming. Also, I want to get some first-hand idea of `lambda-culculus` from a functional programming language because I want to learn more about Turing and Church's idea of computability. `Haskell` seems to be a good candidate, but I am still behind my schedule.

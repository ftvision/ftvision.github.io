## Introduction

Programming, in its simplest form, is to ask the computer to do things. The computer is both the smartest and dumbest machine at the same time. It is smart, because it can do incredibly complicated tasks and can even beat human in some cognitive tasks. It is dumb, because it can only do what it is asked to do.

#### Learning Coding is **Easy**

Programming is **easy**. It only concerns several basic core operations and logics: To receive, store, manipulate, and export data, to control the flow of procedures, to loop the same procedure again and again, to jump between different procedures. Therefore, learning to code should not be a daunting task. It should be natural, playful, and enjoyable. Moreover, different programming languages, despite their different philosophies and motivations, all carry the same basic core operations. When one manages one language, it could be easy for him/her to translate to another language to do basic tasks and operations.

You should start to enjoy coding.

#### Mastering Coding is **Hard**

Programming is also **hard**. There are countless ways of organizing and integrating the basic operations. The same logics, with the help of algorithms and data structures, can be implemented in different ways by different languages. There are also hacks and tricks, which help to make a program work. **In my opinion, we should respect and emphasize on the logic of programming.** 

Keep calm and go coding.

# WHy I waste my time?

One of the reason that I waste my time is because I don't want to do the current work. Yes, it is procrastination. By this force, I actively dodge the work I should take, and they seem not interesting enough for me to take actions. 最重要的是我刷renren什么的不需要动脑子，只是简单的浏览。但是阅读其他任何东西都有一种“想要获取一些什么东西，想要学到写什么东西”的功利冲动。功利性太强的结果是觉得做事情的时候没有获得点什么总觉得是在浪费时间。所以休息不能好好休息，学习不能好好学习。

之所以会浪费时间，是因为有一件事情不要费脑子，也不用想着要花资源去理解，也不用想着要花心思去学习。

这根本上就还是一种避重就轻的心里——因为刷renren是轻，而学习是重，是难，是不愉快，是花认知资源。如果做另外一件事情能够让我保持轻松地态度。

>> The solutions may be

>> Make the project smaller and specify intermediate goal. I find that prioirty cannot be leveled up simply by thinking something is important. The way to prioritize something is to make something doable. 

>> train the concentration time: keep concentrated for a period of time and try to shut up all the incoming information during that time. This is to work with papers. 

>> Do not look ahead. Looking ahead sometimes make me desparate because I still have a lot left. 

Another reason is because I fyeel tired and cannot stay awake. I may go back to bed and fall asleep, or directly fall asleep on the table.

>> The solutions may be 

>> 1) Do not work in bed or lying on the bed. 

>> 2) Have regular rest. I need to learn the quick-charging method. 

>> 3) I may indeed need Coffee or tea to help.

>> 4) Sometimes music can help. 

I have no patience to finish a big project, no matter whether it is my research project or life project. This indicates that I lack of the ability of project management. Problems include that I don't know what projects are going. It seems very hard for me to know what exactly projects are going right now I always add or drop projects with no efficient track. 

I am still over optimized my ability of running projects at the same time. This is also due to my obssess of hard-working. The mismatch of my ability and the single-minded belief in hard working, always resulted in a long-time period of running away from some projects or awful procrastination. 

For each project:
1) Do I want to do
2) How much do I want to do
3) If my performance is mediocre, is that OK
4) What is it's priority
5) Any reward or penalty?
6) 


# What am I doing to waste my time?

1. Renren.com / Facebook.com / Weibo
	设置固定的时间去浏览更新

2. Douban
	Use it to write diaries or look for Dongxi.

3. Wondering where to surf the internet
	Read regular blogs. 
	Read RSS
	Exploitation v.s. Exploration：要整理一下现在的浏览器收藏夹，要整理一下哪些内容要看。主要是如何学习和获取已经有的知识，和跟上前沿消息的节奏。
	关于已经沉淀下来的知识，我需要的是一个稳定的计划去学习(Studying)
	关于前沿消息，我需要的是一个习惯去获取(Forward Looking)

4. Think about my old relationship and my two ex-girlfriends.
	These emotional distractors are extremly powerful because I could immerse myself in this flow and never step out again. 
	每当想起这些就会无法抑制地哀伤。这绝对是个无底洞，一旦朝着这边走，就会滑下去，而且一滑就是触不到底。
	现在想偷窥了解的内容，不过就是她们现在过得怎么样，是不是开心了，最近去哪里了，有了什么新的奇遇之类的。
	当然，同时我的确是感受到了无法治愈的孤独感。这种孤独感似乎我也从来没有跟谁说起过，只是觉得我自己都无法言语表述了，那么也没有别的人会理解了。

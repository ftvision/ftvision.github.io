How we perceive what we see? While Dr. James Gibson may say our visual system directly picks up the existed information in the world and thus we have the perception, I am more inclined to the idea that our perception is an inference process of what might be happening in the outside world. This unconscious inference view of perception can be dated back to Hermann von Helmholtz.

Lots of factors shape our online perception. For example, our inherent brain structures set a constrain on what we can perceive. Additionally, our past experience affect what we see at present as well. All of these factors have a long lasting effects on our perception, but here I want to explore a different idea: **what is our mind right now affects what we perceive at present**. I want to explore the moment-to-moment change, or fluctuation, of perception. 

To study this hypothesis, I asked participants do a perception task while they have to memorize some materials. I want to see how the contents in working memory changes the perception.

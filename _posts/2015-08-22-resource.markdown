#### Programming 
* R Basics
: <code>online resource: </code> Eric Nord's [Essential R](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat497r/sites/onlinecourses.science.psu.edu.stat497r/files/Essential%20R.pdf) and Winston Chang's [cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) are good materials to start R. <br > <code>book: </code> Paul Teetor's [R Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-OReilly-Cookbooks-Paul-Teetor/dp/0596809158) is an excellent and comprehensive introductory book to start R. <br > <code>cheatsheet: </code>If you are familiar with Matlab, this [cheatsheet](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/octave-r.html) will be very helpful for you to transfer from Matlab/Octave to R. 

* R advanced
: Since R is mainly a programming language for statistical computations, the advanced topics in R programming are related to statistics. Daniel Wollschlaeger's [R Examples Repository](http://www.uni-kiel.de/psychologie/rexrepos/index.html) has a good collection of advanced topics in R.

* Python
: To be added.

#### Data Analysis, Statistics, and Machine Learning
* Hypothesis Testing

* Data Science Courses Resources
: Johns Hopkins University offers a [data science specialization track](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

#### Neuroimaging 
* (functional) Magnetic Resonance Imaging

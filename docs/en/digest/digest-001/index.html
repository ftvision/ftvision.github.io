<p>Based on the trading, Snowflake&rsquo;s market cap valuation is $60 billio, but its revenue over the last 12 months was $403 million. Based on that, their market cap is around 150x their revenue..</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth Rate is high: 121% year-over-year growth. 2x the 75% metrics of the companies with similar revenue. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/24/how-fast-should-you-be-growing/">Growth Banchmark</a></li>
<li>Retention Rate is high: 158%. For every $1 of revenue Snowflake received from their customers a year ago, that same pool of customers are now paying $1.58. <a href="https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/what-is-good-retention-issue-29">Retention Benchmark</a></li>
<li>Net promoter score (NPS) is a way of measuring customer satisfaction: 71. (Apple, 62; AirBnB: 42) <a href="https://www.satmetrix.com/infographic/2020-us-consumer-benchmarks/">NPS Benchmark from satmetrix</a></li>
<li>Average Contract Value
<ul>
<li>The average Snowflake customer pays Snowflake $165k a year. <a href="https://dskok-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-KBCM-SaaS-Survey.pdf">Benchmark from  KBCM Technology Group</a>: 29% of software businesses have an ACV between $50k-$250k, and only 9% have an ACV greater than $250k.</li>
<li>Snowflake has 56 customers that pay them over $1M a year</li>
<li>Capital One pays $29M.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Net Loss
<ul>
<li>Revenue under GAAP: Under GAAP, Snowflake doesn&rsquo;t count revenue when a customer pays them, but instead when a customer uses the Snowflake product.
<ul>
<li>As an example, let&rsquo;s say a customer purchases one year of Snowflake credits for $100k. That money winds up in Snowflake&rsquo;s bank account, but Snowflake cannot count that $100k as revenue until Snowflake delivers the service, which is when the customer uses their credits for compute time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The thing is they are spending A LOT on sales and marketing.
<ul>
<li>Their total net loss for the last six months was $171M while during the same time period they spent $191M on sales and marketing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Martin Kleppmann, the author of <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em>, explains reflects on his experiences of publishing the book.</p>
<ul>
<li>Metrics: 100,000 copies sold.</li>
<li>Financial perspective: a good passive income since the book is very popular. The profit for each book is small, but the time and the number helps.</li>
<li>Beyond the royalities: 50 talks, blog posts, and other social media helps establish a significant public presence and reputation in this field.
<ul>
<li>this kind of reputation is helpful for getting consulting gigs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That is further financial value that writing a book can bring: you become recognised as an expert and an authority in an area, and companies will pay good money to get advice from such experts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I also find it heartening that it is possible to make a decent living from technical writing. Not guaranteed, but possible, and that gives me hope.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A book is accessible education
<ul>
<li>A book is universally accessible: it is affordable to almost everyone, anywhere in the world.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course there are also plenty of free resources online: Wikipedia, blog posts, videos, Stack Overflow, API documentation, research papers, and so on. These are good as reference material for answering a concrete question that you have (such as “what are the parameters of the function foo?”), but they are piecemeal fragments that are difficult to assemble into a coherent education.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compared to teaching people in person, a book is vastly more scalable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creating more value than you capture
<blockquote>
<p>Writing a book is an activity that creates more value than it captures. What I mean with this is that the benefits that readers get from it are greater than the price they paid for the book. To back this up, let’s try roughly estimating the value created by my book.
If I spend 2.5 years writing a book, and it saves other people 833 years of time in aggregate, that is over 300x leverage.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>How to be a 10x engineer: help ten other engineers be twice as good. Producing high-quality educational materials enables you to be a 300x engineer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing a technical book is not easy, but it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>valuable (it helps people be better at their job),</li>
<li>scalable (large numbers of people can benefit from it),</li>
<li>accessible (it doesn’t discriminate who can benefit), and</li>
<li>economically viable (it is possible to generate a reasonable level of income from it).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the downside, writing a book is really hard, at least if you want to do it well. For me it was about the same level of difficulty as building and selling a startup (YMMV), that is to say, involving multiple existential crises. The writing process was not good for my mental health.</p>

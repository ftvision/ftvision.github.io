I am fine with open research, but I value a healthy feedback loop to narrow down the scopes and to refine problems.\nCollaborative working atmosphere I can work collaboratively and independently. The key, however, is to have a supportive and collaborative team to work together, respectful and trustworthy, and organically combine collaborative and independent work. In such a team, I can get help from others as well as providing help to others. I can feel comfortable to ask and answer questions without feeling stupid or being looked down upon. This is a mutual commitment, between me and my co-worker.\nFeedback is also important.\nCompetition is fine, but I don’t want to go to a team where most people full of sense of competition and undermine the idea that we can make it bigger if all of us working together. Understand the real competitor is people in other companies, not the one who work with you and want to make things better together. If teammates always treat each other as enemy, I don’t feel comfortable working with them.\nAlso, I want to join a team where people really care about the quality of their work and are passionate about what they are doing.\npositive example: I worked in a team where I can ask questions and my mentor always teach me patiently. Sometimes he also extends more than what I asked, and direct me to more references. I am encouraged to ask questions, and I am also encouraged to search more answers and learn more by my own before I turn to ask him. The interaction is very friendly and supportive, and I felt very comfortable to discuss my new ideas, to ask for suggestions, and to push things forward.\nnegative example: I worked in a team where I don’t feel collaborative or supportive. Although asking questions are encouraged, I always find the feedbacks and interactions when asking questions are really uncomfortable. Either, I was told to think more, without guidance; or, I was told my explorations and trials are useless, even “shit”. The interaction process frustrates me. It also makes me afraid of asking questions because I felt I am stupid and always ask wrong questions and making useless efforts. Very uncomfortable experience.\nPersonal Growth and Career developments I want a job that can:\n enhance my expertise enable me to contribute my intelligence and skills teach me new things that I don’t know give me a bigger picture of the field where I work (can be a gradual process) realize my potential  negative example: I worked in a team in which I constantly feel I didn’t learn new things, and cannot contribute at all. I kept making efforts and asking questions, but my feedbacks are my efforts are useless. I feel I cannot realize my potential in this team and I am unable to contribute my value in this team. I don’t want someone throw me a project and let me figure it out but don’t want to discuss with me.\nReal impacts I want my work to have real impacts on users, products, systems, and companies. This is one major reason why I want to go industry and leave academia. I want to see what are the results and impacts of my work. If they are good, I want to make it better; if they are not good, I want to improve it. Such impacts can reinforce my sense of ownership of my work. I stand by the quality of my work and am willing to make it more influential, more helpful, more robust, more scalable.\npositive example: I once made an AI system for a game and such a system brought a significant change for the game – we don’t even use human to direct the game during our daily game-playing event. Also, people use this system a lot and provide me feedbacks of the pros and cons of the system. I find such a work has a real impact on users and I feel very happy about it.\nnegative example: I have done a lot of research that end with going no where, neither published nor helping others. It makes me feel that I am wasting time and not making anything real.\nReflecting My expertise I am always willing to learn and I can learn very fast. Have solid understanding of human vision, cognition, and cognitive psychology Have very good background in algorithm and data-structure – due to my competitive programming experiences  could be stronger with Leetcode preparation   Mainly good at Python and C/C++  Python now is the strongest [Still enhancing in multiple advanced aspects] C/C++ has working experiences, and can be stronger   Very good Machine Learning and Statistics backgrounds  Applied math degree Multiple hands-on projects and daily research experiences Has a good sense of different machine learning algorithms CONS: do not have many real-world experiences   Weakness:  won’t be able to start web-developing because don’t have enough experiences in different frameworks, so cannot do full-stack web developing. BUT I CAN LEARN. still need to enhance SQL and/or map-reduce    Ranking My Preference  VR/AR related visual/perceptual/cognitive research scientist  This is closely related to my Ph.D. research and many interesting questions are to be asked and answered Such positions can work with engineers and contribute to the final products, so I can see the results of my research. I can also join the engineering team because I also have a programming background, so I can diversity my work and gain new expertise   Machine Learning related research scientist or engineers / Algorithm developer  I have gain machine learning experiences both in my research and courses, now I want to apply them to real-world Application I can contribute to some real product and see machine learning in action. I can continue enjoy doing research and making sense of data. Automation!   General Software Engineers at interesting companies.  creating new things!

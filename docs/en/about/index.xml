      <title>Resume of Failures</title>

      <description>This is a list of what I have tried during my journey. It is a running list of my failures during my journey. The idea is inspired by Prof. Johannes Haushoferi. I was trying to summarize all of them, but some may have eluded my memory. I will keep maintaining this list, so future failures will be recorded and updated. You are welcome to come back and check my latest failures.</description>

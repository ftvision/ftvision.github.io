<h1>Animation</h1>
Every January, April, July, and October, a new season of animations will be released. I usually pick three to five animations in one season and update each of them weekly. 

>Animation is not childish at all! Itâ€™s a world, a exceptional, splendid world. Animations tell stories, stories of reality and beyond reality. I always gain the power, knowledge from them. I laugh and I cry; I am hurt and healed.
